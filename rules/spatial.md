## Module: R-Tree Structure

### ST-01: Node MBR correctness `[fatal][silent]`
  invariant ∀ leaf L: L.NodeMBR == union(L.entries[0..count-1].coords)
  invariant ∀ internal I: I.NodeMBR == union(I.children[0..count-1].NodeMBR)
  invariant ∀ internal I, ∀ i: I.entries[i].coords == I.children[i].NodeMBR
    (the second invariant is only reachable through this one — RefitInternalMBR unions I's OWN entry
     array, so a caller that refits without first refreshing the changed entry produces a too-tight I)
  scope: every caller that refits an internal node — SpatialRTree.PropagateSplit (both the current-level
    absorb and the ancestor loop), RefitAncestors, RefitAncestorsBottomUp, WriteInternalEntry, BulkLoad,
    RemoveEmptyLeaf, SplitInternalNode
    NOT the SpatialNodeHelper primitives (RefitLeafMBR / RefitInternalMBR / ExpandLeafMBR): all three are
    correct in isolation, and scoping the rule to them is precisely what let #588 pass a scope-driven
    review — the invariant lives or dies in the callers
  on_violation:
    MBR too tight → queries miss entities (false negatives, silent data loss for game logic)
    MBR too loose → unnecessary subtree visits (performance only)
  detection: TreeValidator.ValidateInternalEntryFreshness. Recomputing a node's MBR from its own entries
    (ValidateMBRTightness alone) CANNOT see staleness — it compares a value against itself. Violations are
    also transient: the next insert descending the same path refreshes the entry and heals it, so an
    end-of-workload check comes back clean. Validate at checkpoints DURING mutation, never only after.

### ST-02: Union category mask — never under-represents `[perf]`
  invariant ∀ leaf L: L.UnionCategoryMask ⊇ OR(L.entries[0..count-1].CategoryMask)
  invariant ∀ internal I: I.UnionCategoryMask ⊇ OR(I.children[0..count-1].UnionCategoryMask)
  never UnionCategoryMask missing a bit that exists in a descendant entry
  scope: SpatialNodeHelper.RefitLeafMBR, SpatialRTree.RefitInternalUnionMask, RemoveEmptyLeaf
  on_violation: subtree pruning skips entities matching the query mask → false negatives
    (transient over-representation after remove is acceptable — causes extra visits, not missed results)

### ST-03: Parent pointer consistency `[fatal][silent]`
  invariant ∀ node N where N ≠ root: N.ParentChunkId points to an internal node containing N as a child
  invariant root.ParentChunkId == 0
  scope: SpatialRTree.Insert, Split, Remove, CreateNewRoot
  on_violation: RefitAncestorsBottomUp follows wrong chain; MBRs diverge from actual data;
    tree structure silently degrades over time

### ST-04: Entity count accuracy `[silent]`
  invariant _entityCount == sum(∀ leaf L: L.Count)
  requires: Interlocked operations on _entityCount
  scope: SpatialRTree.Insert, InsertWithSplit, Remove
  on_violation: kNN initial radius estimate degrades; TreeValidator reports inconsistency;
    persisted metadata disagrees with tree content

### ST-05: Back-pointer consistency `[fatal]`
  invariant ∀ entity E in tree: BackPointer[E.entityId] == (E.leafChunkId, E.slotIndex, treeSelector)
  invariant the back-pointer KEY is stable for the entity's lifetime — invariant under MVCC revision minting,
            cluster migration, and leaf-slot swap. A key that can be re-minted while the entity is alive is
            not a valid back-pointer key, however convenient it is to reach.
  scope: SpatialMaintainer.InsertSpatial / UpdateSpatialCore / RemoveFromSpatial, SpatialRTree.ScatterLeafEntries, Remove
  on_violation: the lookup misses, the update falls through to a fresh Insert, the prior leaf entry is orphaned →
    duplicate EntityIds in the tree (TreeValidator "R5 violation"); or update/remove targets the wrong leaf slot
  rationale: 🔴 CORRECTED 2026-07-27. This rule previously keyed the back-pointer on `componentChunkId` — the key the
    implementation uses and the direct cause of confirmed bug #548. MVCC re-mints the content chunk id per revision, so
    for StorageMode.Versioned the lookup misses and every update double-inserts; SingleVersion is unaffected because
    its chunk id is stable. The design series specified `entityId` all along (03-tree-operations.md invariant B1,
    05-ecs-integration.md ReadBackPointer(entityId)). The rule had diverged from its own design and therefore RATIFIED
    the defect — which is why review never flagged the implementation. The key-stability clause is the missing half:
    re-keying alone states the what without the why, and the next storage mode reintroduces it.

### ST-06: OLC version validity `[fatal]`
  invariant ∀ node: OlcVersion ≥ 4 (version ≥ 1, lock=0, obsolete=0) when not write-locked
  never OlcVersion == 0 for an allocated, non-locked node
  scope: SpatialRTree.AllocNode, OlcLatch
  on_violation: queries see version 0 → restart loop; if node permanently stuck at 0 → infinite retry

---

## Module: Queries

### SQ-01: Query completeness — no false negatives `[fatal]`
  invariant ∀ query Q, ∀ entity E:
    E geometrically matches Q ∧ (Q.categoryMask == 0 ∨ (E.CategoryMask & Q.categoryMask) == Q.categoryMask)
    → E ∈ result set
  scope: SpatialRTree.Query.cs (all enumerators), CountInAABB
  on_violation: spatial query misses entities — game logic sees incomplete world state
  requires: ST-01 (MBR correctness), ST-02 (union mask not under-representing)

### SQ-02: Category mask semantics — AND-conjunctive `[fatal]`
  invariant categoryMask == 0 → no category filtering (all entities match)
  invariant categoryMask ≠ 0 → entry matches iff (entry.CategoryMask & categoryMask) == categoryMask
  never (entry.CategoryMask & categoryMask) != 0 treated as a match (that would be OR-disjunctive)
  scope: all query enumerators, CountInAABB leaf scan
  on_violation: queries return wrong entity set — wrong enemies targeted, wrong zones triggered

### SQ-03: Count query consistency `[fatal]`
  invariant CountInAABB(region, mask) == |{ E : E ∈ QueryAABB(region, mask) }|
  scope: SpatialRTree.CountInAABB, AABBQueryEnumerator
  on_violation: count disagrees with materialized query — game logic makes wrong density decisions

### SQ-04: Subtree counting shortcut correctness `[fatal]`
  invariant fully-contained flag propagation: node fully contained → all descendants fully contained
  invariant fullyContained ∧ categoryMask == 0 → count += nodeCount (no per-entry work)
  invariant fullyContained ∧ categoryMask ≠ 0 → skip overlap tests, still check per-entry category mask
  never fullyContained ∧ categoryMask ≠ 0 → count += nodeCount (would over-count)
  scope: SpatialRTree.CountInAABB
  on_violation: count is wrong — over-count if category check skipped, under-count if entries missed

### SQ-05: Traversal buffer safety `[silent]`
  invariant stackTop < 256 for all DFS-based queries
  invariant RayEnumerator never drops a child that hits within maxDist while below MaxRayHeapCapacity
  scope: AABBQueryEnumerator, OccupantQueryEnumerator, FrustumEnumerator, CountInAABB, RayEnumerator
  on_violation: children silently dropped → incomplete results with no error indication.
    The overflow branch records SpatialRTreeDiagnostics.RecordDfsStackOverflow — an always-on counter, deliberately
    non-throwing because an optimistic read latch is held. Corrected 2026-07-27: this rule previously said
    "Debug.Fail fires in debug builds only"; there are no Debug.Fail calls on this path, and the drop is observable
    in every build via that counter.
  ray heap (added 2026-07-31, #589): the ray priority queue is NOT a fixed buffer. Its 64-entry inline array is a
    fast path that spills to pooled arrays on demand, so a dense scene stays complete; only MaxRayHeapCapacity
    (a corrupt/cyclic-tree backstop, not a scene limit) drops children, and it records like the DFS sites.
    Ordinary growth increments RayHeapSpillCount — a perf signal, not a correctness one.
    The rule previously scoped only the four DFS enumerators, so nothing covered the ray path at all: it folded
    `_heapSize < 64` into its push condition with no else and no counter, and a dense scene silently lost ~80% of
    its hits. Frontier size is NOT bounded by tree depth — a ray whose subtrees share an entry distance holds them
    all pending at once — so no depth-derived constant may be used to bound it.
  detection: a scene that partitions ALONG the ray axis cannot reach this. Front-to-back popping then drains
    depth-first (siblings get well-separated entry distances) and the frontier stays at 5-15 nodes, which is why
    the pre-existing 200-entity ray test never filled the heap. Partition PERPENDICULAR to the ray so every node
    shares an entry distance and siblings pile up unconsumed.

## Module: Fat AABB Updates

### SF-01: Fat AABB containment — fast vs slow path `[perf]`
  invariant E.tightAABB ⊂ E.fatAABB → no tree mutation (fast path, ~25ns)
  invariant E.tightAABB ⊄ E.fatAABB → remove + reinsert with new fat AABB (slow path, ~500ns)
  scope: SpatialMaintainer.UpdateSpatial
  on_violation: entity position diverges from tree position; queries return stale spatial data

### SF-02: Static tree skip `[perf]`
  never tick fence / batch update processing visits static tree entities
  scope: SpatialMaintainer, SpatialIndexState
  on_violation: wasted CPU on immutable data; potential accidental mutation of bulk-loaded tree

---

## Module: Trigger Volumes

### TV-01: Event completeness `[fatal]`
  invariant ∀ entity transition (outside→inside) between consecutive evaluations → exactly one Enter event
  invariant ∀ entity transition (inside→outside) between consecutive evaluations → exactly one Leave event
  never an entity inside at both evaluations produces Enter or Leave (only Stay if subscribed)
  scope: SpatialTriggerSystem.EvaluateRegion
  on_violation: game logic misses zone transitions or fires duplicate events

### TV-02: Frequency contract `[perf]`
  invariant region with EvaluationFrequency = N evaluated at most once every N ticks
  scope: SpatialTriggerSystem.Evaluate
  on_violation: region evaluated too often (wasted CPU) or not often enough (missed transitions)

---

## Module: Interest Management

### IM-01: No missed changes `[fatal]`
  invariant ∀ entity E mutated at tick T, ∀ observer O where O.LastConsumedTick < T ≤ currentTick:
    E within O.InterestRegion ∧ (E.CategoryMask & O.CategoryMask) matches
    → E ∈ O.ChangeBuffer
  scope: SpatialInterestSystem.GetSpatialChanges
  on_violation: observer misses entity update → client sees stale state → desync

### IM-02: Ring buffer safety `[fatal]`
  invariant currentTick - observer.LastConsumedTick > RingSize → observer flagged for full sync
  never stale (recycled) bitmaps used for dirty accumulation
  scope: SpatialInterestSystem.GetSpatialChanges, DirtyBitmapRing
  on_violation: observer uses recycled bitmap data → phantom changes or missed changes

### IM-03: SV-only scope `[fatal]`
  invariant interest management dirty tracking only applies to SingleVersion ComponentTables
  never Versioned tables participate in ring buffer system
  scope: SpatialInterestSystem
  on_violation: DirtyBitmap infrastructure doesn't exist for Versioned → crash or undefined behavior

---

## Module: Cluster Spatial AABBs (Issue #230)

### CA-01: Per-cluster AABB containment `[fatal][silent]`
  invariant 🔴 FRAME (#872 step 9, decision C15): A is stored CELL-RELATIVE — offsets from the world-space minimum
    corner of C's cell, which SpatialGrid.CellOrigin derives from ClusterCellMap[C.chunkId]. E.spatialAABB is
    world-space. The containment below therefore only holds once both sides are in the SAME frame, and the rule is
    read literally false for every cluster in a cell whose origin is non-zero if that is forgotten. C13
    (cluster→cell exclusivity) is what makes the origin unique per cluster and hence what makes the frame
    well-defined at all — CA-01 depends on C13 and not merely alongside it.
  invariant ∀ active cluster C with ClusterAabbs[C.chunkId] = A:
    toCellRelative(union(∀ occupied entity E in C: E.spatialAABB), origin(C)) ⊆ A
    (degenerate entities with NaN/Inf bounds are excluded from the union)
    conversion rounds AWAY from the entity — min down, max up (ClusterSpatialAabb.ToCellRelativeMin/Max). The
    narrowing to f32 is where the error is: round-to-nearest can place a bound INSIDE the entity it must contain,
    which is this rule's own silent failure mode.
  invariant 🔴 the QUERY side shares the frame or the rule is unobservable: AabbClusterEnumerator.SetCellQueryFrame
    converts the query box into the cell's frame with the OPPOSITE-signed rounding (outward on both sides). A box
    narrowed by one ULP there drops a cluster grazing its edge — an SQ-01 false negative that no containment check
    on the storage side can see.
  invariant RecomputeClusterAabb scans all occupied slots via TZCNT loop
    over the 64-bit occupancy word and calls ReadAndValidateBoundsFromPtr per slot
  post after the refresh pass: ∀ cluster C selected by ClusterProcessBitmap:
    ClusterAabbs[C.chunkId] ⊇ union of C's live entity AABBs, and == the exact union when a shrink was pending
    (corrected 2026-07-28: the pass no longer reads dirtyBits — it is driven by ClusterProcessBitmap +
     ClusterShrinkPendingAxes; and on the common grow path the CAS-grown superset is kept, never re-tightened,
     so "exact union" holds only when shrinkMask != 0)
  invariant 🔴 ClusterAabbs[chunkId] has EXACTLY ONE writer class at any instant:
    (a) CAS-grow from ClusterRef.WriteSpatial / MaybeGrowAndFlagShrink, during system dispatch
    (b) blind full-struct store from the AabbRefresh fence phase
    The tick barrier separating dispatch from the fence is what makes (b) safe, and it is LOAD-BEARING. Relax it and
    the fence store silently discards concurrent grows → AABB too tight → this rule's own containment fails.
  scope: ArchetypeClusterState.RecomputeClusterAabb, RecomputeDirtyClusterAabbs, RecomputeDirtyClusterAabbsSlice
         (the parallel path that performs the store), RebuildClusterAabbs,
         ClusterRef.WriteSpatial / MaybeGrowAndFlagShrink (the concurrent writer class),
         ClusterRef.TryGetCellOrigin, ClusterSpatialAabb.ToCellRelativeMin, ClusterSpatialAabb.ToCellRelativeMax,
         SpatialGrid.CellOrigin (the frame the containment is expressed in — C15),
         AabbClusterEnumerator.SetCellQueryFrame (the query half; without it the invariant is unobservable)
  note the store is a blind `stored = fresh`, not a grow-merge (issue #573). Safe only under the barrier above; any
       overlap scheme must make it a union first. Neither ArchetypeClusterState nor TyphonRuntime contains a single
       Volatile, so the cluster-side read path is not a valid lock-free protocol on a weak memory model regardless of
       load order — arm64 is a supported target.
  on_violation:
    AABB too tight → per-cell cluster spatial queries miss entities (false negatives, silent)
    AABB too loose → extra overlap tests (performance only)
  requires: occupancy word accurately reflects live slots

## Module: VDB Cell Grid (Issue #872 step 8)

### VG-01: A cell key names a live cell, or nothing `[fatal][silent]`
  invariant a cell key is a POOL SLOT in SpatialGrid's CellState pool, not a coordinate:
    ∀ key k handed out by ComputeCellKey / WorldToCellKey / TryGetCellKey: k ∈ [0, SpatialGrid.CellCount)
    ∀ such k: CellKeyToCoords(k) == the (x, y, z) the key was resolved from
  invariant a coordinate with no cell resolves to ABSENT, never to another cell's key:
    TryGetCellKey(x, y, z, out k) == false → k < 0
    TryGetNeighbourCellKey over a block that has not been created → false, and true once it is
  invariant cell keys are NOT stable across a rebuild or a ResetCellState — slots are handed out in
    creation order, so nothing may cache a key across either
  invariant creation is monotonic: a cell, once created, is never removed or renumbered while the grid
    lives (step 8 ships no destruction path; §3.5's windowed sweep is deferred)
  scope: SpatialGrid.ComputeCellKey, SpatialGrid.TryGetCellKey, SpatialGrid.TryGetNeighbourCellKey,
    SpatialGrid.CellKeyToCoords, SpatialGrid.ResetCellState, VdbBlockKey.Pack
  verified: VdbSpatialGridTests (AC82_NeighbourAcrossAnAbsentBlockBoundary_IsAbsentThenAppears carries the
    attribute; ResetCellState_InvalidatesTheBlockCacheOnEveryThread and AC84_RebuildFromTheSamePopulation
    cover the stability and monotonicity clauses). VdbBlockKeyTests covers the packing clause but carries no
    attribute of its own — the packing is reached through every one of these.
  on_violation:
    a remembered "absent" that later has a cell → query misses every cluster in it → SQ-01 false negative
    a block key that truncates an axis → two regions alias one block → each query returns the other's clusters
    a cached key surviving a rebuild → counters read against a cell that now belongs to a different position

### VG-02: Read paths never create cells `[perf][fatal]`
  invariant only a path that must PLACE something resolves with create — entity spawn, migration
    destination, and the rebuild's serial reduce. Everything else uses TryGetCellKey:
    query broadphase (AabbClusterEnumerator), tier assignment (SetTierInAABB, the accessor's
    coordinate-keyed setters), and every diagnostic or demo sweep
  invariant the rebuild's PARALLEL map phase resolves to COORDINATES only (ReadCellCoordsFromSpatialField).
    Creating from the map would make each pool slot a function of the worker count, which
    RebuildSpatialStateFromData's serial reduce exists to prevent
  invariant SpatialGridAccessor.GetCell(x, y, z) is the ONE coordinate-keyed accessor that DOES create, and
    exists for tests and diagnostics that need a cell to write into. Game code reading grid state must not use it
  note the determinism guarantee is REBUILD-ONLY. Migration destinations are created from fence workers, so a
    pool slot's index depends on worker interleaving there; only RebuildSpatialStateFromData promises a
    worker-count-independent numbering, and it does so by creating in its serial reduce
  scope: AabbClusterEnumerator.MoveNext, SpatialGrid.SetTierInAABB, SpatialGridAccessor.SetCellTier,
    SpatialGridAccessor.SetCellTierMin, SpatialGridAccessor.ComputeCellKey, SpatialGridAccessor.WorldToCell,
    SpatialGridAccessor.GetCell, ArchetypeClusterState.MapClusterForRebuild
  verified: VdbSpatialGridTests (ReadPaths_DoNotCreateCells carries the attribute and covers
    SpatialGrid.TryGetCellKey / TryGetCellKeyAt / SetTierInAABB). The accessor surface, the query broadphase and
    the parallel map phase are NOT directly verified — they are covered only indirectly, by the suite staying
    green with sparse memory
  on_violation:
    a read path resolving with create → one cell per swept coordinate → the grid silently becomes dense
      again, with correct answers and the memory C2 exists to avoid. Nothing fails; ResidentBytes is the
      only observable
    creating from the parallel map → pool slots depend on thread interleaving → rebuild output stops being
      bit-identical across worker counts

## Module: ClusterCellMap (Issue #229)

### CC-01: ClusterCellMap validity `[fatal]`
  invariant ∀ active cluster C:
    ClusterCellMap == null ∨ C.chunkId ≥ ClusterCellMap.Length ∨
    ClusterCellMap[C.chunkId] ∈ [-1, SpatialGrid.CellCount)
  invariant ClusterCellMap[chunkId] ≥ 0 → cluster is assigned to a valid cell
  invariant ClusterCellMap[chunkId] < 0 → cluster is unassigned (skipped by TierClusterIndex)
  note the bound moved in #872 step 8. CellCount was the whole world's cell count, fixed at config time;
    it is now the number of cells that EXIST, which grows as cells are first touched. The invariant is
    unchanged in FORM but WEAKER as a detector: against a world-sized bound a stale or corrupted key was
    usually out of range and threw, whereas a small growing bound accepts it silently. A key is meaningful
    only against the grid instance that issued it, and only until a rebuild (VG-01)
  note transiently false between ResetCellState and the rebuild that follows it — the map still holds the
    old keys while the grid holds no cells. RebuildSpatialStateFromData refills both; nothing may read
    ClusterCellMap in between
  scope: ArchetypeClusterState.ClaimSlotInCell, RebuildCellState, RebuildSpatialStateFromData, TierClusterIndex.Rebuild
  on_violation:
    cellKey ≥ CellCount → IndexOutOfRangeException in SpatialGrid.GetCell
    cellKey corrupted → cluster bucketed into wrong cell → wrong tier assignment, wrong query results
    cellKey held across a rebuild → names a different position's cell → silently wrong counters and tiers

---

## Module: TierClusterIndex (Issue #231)

### TI-01: Rebuild-before-dispatch ordering `[fatal]`
  invariant [RebuildIfStale] → [any parallel system reads per-tier arrays]
  invariant RebuildIfStale runs single-threaded at tick start (BuildTierIndexesAtTickStart)
    before any parallel system dispatch begins
  invariant Debug: Interlocked.CompareExchange(_rebuildInProgress, 1, 0) == 0
    asserts no concurrent Rebuild calls
  scope: TierClusterIndex.Rebuild, TierClusterIndex.RebuildIfStale, TyphonRuntime.BuildTierIndexesAtTickStart
  on_violation: parallel readers see partially-written tier arrays → torn reads, wrong cluster lists,
    clusters dispatched to wrong systems

### TI-02: Single-bit tier byte at rebuild `[fatal]`
  invariant ∀ cell processed during Rebuild:
    BitOperations.PopCount(cell.Tier) == 1
  invariant Debug.Assert validates single-bit at rebuild (TZCNT maps directly to array index)
  requires: SC-01 (SetCellTier rejects multi-bit flags)
  scope: TierClusterIndex.Rebuild
  on_violation: PopCount > 1 → TZCNT maps to wrong tier index → cluster assigned to wrong tier array

### TI-03: TierVersion monotonicity `[silent]`
  invariant _tierVersion only increments (never decremented or reset to 0)
  invariant SetCellTier: no-op when cell.Tier == (byte)tier (no spurious version bump)
  invariant ResetAllTiers: bumps _tierVersion at most once, only when at least one cell actually changed
  scope: SpatialGrid.SetCellTier, SpatialGrid.ResetAllTiers, SpatialGrid.SetCellTierMin
  on_violation:
    spurious bumps → unnecessary TierClusterIndex rebuilds (perf only, not correctness)
    missed bumps → TierClusterIndex uses stale tier assignment → systems process wrong clusters

---

## Module: Migration Dirty Bits (Issue #232)

### MD-01: Post-migration dirty bit consistency `[fatal][silent]`
  invariant after ExecuteMigrations for each migrated entity (src → dst):
    dirtyBits[srcChunkId] bit srcSlot is cleared
    dirtyBits[dstChunkId] bit dstSlot is set
  invariant if dstChunkId ≥ dirtyBits.Length:
    Array.Resize(ref dirtyBits, max(dirtyBits.Length * 2, dstChunkId + 1))
  invariant caller's ref parameter is updated so subsequent readers
    (DirtyRing archive, WAL publish loop, PreviousTickDirtySnapshot) see the grown array
  scope: DatabaseEngine.ExecuteMigrations (lines 1630-1645)
  on_violation:
    source bit not cleared → WAL serializes stale/zeroed source slot → corrupt replay
    dest bit not set → WAL misses new slot data → entity lost on crash recovery
    array not grown → IndexOutOfRangeException or silent skip of new destination cluster

### MD-02: Parallel migration apply — concurrent-mutation primitives `[fatal][silent]`
  invariant during ExecuteMigrationsSlice (parallel-fence Migrate phase, multiple workers per archetype):
    src occupancy bit clear uses Interlocked.And on the cluster's u64 occupancy word
    src per-component EnabledBits clear uses Interlocked.And per component slot
    src cell.EntityCount decrement uses Interlocked.Decrement(ref CellState.EntityCount)
    dst cell.EntityCount / ClusterCount increment uses Interlocked.Increment(ref CellState.*)
    src/dst dirtyBits flips are NOT written by the worker on the parallel path: it appends a
      DirtyBitDelta to its own chunk-local buffer, and OnAfterChunk applies the whole buffer through
      ArchetypeClusterState.ApplyDirtyBitDeltas under _finalizeLock, one acquisition per (chunk x
      archetype). Plain bit ops are correct there BECAUSE the lock excludes sibling workers. Only the
      serial WriteTickFence path (dirtyBuffer == null) writes the array directly, with Interlocked.And /
      Interlocked.Or plus GrowFenceDirtyBitsForChunkId — safe because it is the only thread.
      CORRECTED 2026-08-14: this rule previously specified Interlocked flips from the worker, which the
      implementation has never done — the buffered-plus-lock design shipped in the same PR as the rule.
      A rule that describes a design nobody built cannot catch a regression in the one that exists
    the per-chunk delta buffers are sized in FenceMigrateExecSystem.Prepare, never grown from a worker:
      growing the shared buffer array from concurrent DispatchItem calls loses a bucket when two growers
      race, and the plain reference store is unordered against its Array.Copy on arm64
    cluster-fully-drains path (popcount(prev & ~mask) == 0) does NOT finalize in the worker:
      it records the chunkId via RecordClusterDrain (Interlocked.Increment slot reservation)
      and returns. CellClusterPool.RemoveCluster, RemoveClusterFromPerCellIndex,
      RemoveFromActiveList and ClusterSegment.FreeChunk run later, in
      DrainPendingClusterFinalizations, which re-checks occupancy and skips refilled clusters
  invariant DrainPendingClusterFinalizations runs exactly once per archetype per fence, from
    FinalizeArchetypeFence, AFTER the Migrate and AabbRefresh phase barriers. It takes no lock,
    and must not: its safety is that the barriers exclude every concurrent ClaimSlotInCell and
    ReleaseSlot for this archetype, so the occupancy re-check and the free are single-threaded.
    A lock here would not substitute for the barrier — finalizing while a claimer holds a
    CAS-won slot frees a live chunk no matter who holds what
  invariant FenceDirtyBits is pre-sized in PrepareArchetypeFence's tail BEFORE any Migrate-phase worker
    observes it. The bound is a deliberate over-estimate (max(PrimarySegmentCapacity, existingLen) +
    2*PendingMigrationCount + 64), NOT the strict PrimarySegmentCapacity + PendingMigrationCount this rule
    used to state — that one was observed to under-estimate under AntHill loads. It is a performance
    measure, not the safety argument: the parallel path never touches the array, and the on-demand grow in
    ApplyDirtyBitDeltas / GrowFenceDirtyBitsForChunkId is what actually makes an under-estimate survivable
  invariant PendingMigrations is sorted by DestCellKey (SortPendingMigrationsByDestCellKey)
    by TickDriver between Prep and Migrate dispatches, so each worker slice owns disjoint dst cells
  invariant PendingMigrationCount = 0 reset happens once per fence in FinalizeArchetypeFence
    AFTER all Migrate-phase slices complete, never inside ExecuteMigrationsSlice
  scope: DatabaseEngine.ExecuteMigrations, DatabaseEngine.FinalizeArchetypeFence,
    ArchetypeClusterState.ClearSlotMetadata, ArchetypeClusterState.ApplyDirtyBitDeltas,
    ReleaseSlot (Persistent + Transient overloads), DecrementCellEntityCountOnRelease,
    FinaliseEmptyClusterCellState, ClaimSlotInCell (both overloads),
    RecordClusterDrain, DrainPendingClusterFinalizations
  verified: FenceDirtyBitApplyTests
  on_violation:
    plain ++/-- on cell counters → torn updates across workers → drift in EntityCount/ClusterCount
    plain occupancy clear → lost concurrent slot release → ghost entity in cluster
    worker finalizes inline instead of recording the drain → frees a chunk a concurrent
      ClaimSlotInCell has already CAS-claimed → live entity written into a freed chunk
    finalize pass moved before the phase barriers → same race, now unconditional
    Array.Resize from worker → lost writes from siblings holding the old array reference
    ApplyDirtyBitDeltas called without _finalizeLock while siblings run → its plain bit ops lose
      concurrent flips and its grow drops their writes
    the chunk-buffer array grown from a worker → two growers race, one bucket is dropped from the array,
      and its deltas are lost the moment anything reads buckets back out of the array rather than through
      the reference the worker already holds

### MD-03: False-sharing avoidance for concurrent-mutation state `[perf][fatal]`
  invariant any data structure mutated concurrently from multiple workers isolates each
    independently-mutated element onto its own ≥64-byte cache line
  forbid bit-packed latch arrays (one bit per latch in a shared long[]) — adjacent latches
    share cache lines → catastrophic ping-pong on every CAS even under no logical contention
  prefer AoS (cluster all per-element state into one padded struct) over SoA + parallel
    padded arrays when padding is required — same memory cost, fewer cache-line fetches
  note CellState is [StructLayout(Explicit, Size = 64)] with 24 bytes of fields + 40 reserved
    (corrected 2026-07-27 from a stated 16; corrected again 2026-09-02 when #872 step 8 added
     CellX/CellY/CellZ at offsets 12/16/20 — a cell key became a pool slot and carries no position,
     so the cell has to hold its own coordinates)
  canonical example: CellState (24 bytes of fields, [StructLayout(Explicit, Size=64)],
    40 bytes reserved tail) — Tier, Flags, EntityCount, ClusterCount, CellX/Y/Z all on one line per cell
  applies to: CellState array, ArchetypeClusterState._finalizeLock (PaddedFinalizeLock 64B
    struct), any future per-cell or per-cluster latch arrays
  scope: SpatialGrid.GetCell, ArchetypeClusterState._finalizeLock, any new per-element
    Interlocked-mutated array
  note the dense CellState[] became a CHUNKED pool in #872 step 8. The 64-byte layout is unchanged, and
    the chunking is what keeps the `ref CellState` a stable interior pointer while the pool grows — a
    resize would hand a concurrent worker a doomed array, which is MD-02's concern rather than this one
  on_violation:
    bit-packed latches → 8× ping-pong amplification, parallel speedup collapses
    16-byte cell descriptors in flat array → 4-cell ping-pong per migration
    unpadded shared latch field → adjacent hot fields invalidate the line on every acquire

## Module: Dormancy (Issue #233)

### DM-01: Wake guarantee — max one-tick latency `[fatal]`
  invariant ∀ cluster C in Sleeping state:
    SetDirty(C.chunkId, _) → DormancyReporter.RequestWake(archetypeId, C.chunkId)
  invariant DormancyReporter.DrainAll runs single-threaded at tick fence (WriteClusterTickFence),
    processes all thread-local wake requests, calls ProcessWakeRequest per entry
  invariant ProcessWakeRequest: Sleeping → WakePending (no-op if already WakePending)
  invariant TransitionWakePendingToActive: WakePending → Active at next tick start
    (BuildTierIndexesAtTickStart, before tier index rebuild)
  post maximum latency: dirty write at tick T → WakePending at tick T fence → Active at tick T+1 start
  scope: ArchetypeClusterState.SetDirty, DormancyReporter.RequestWake, DrainAll,
    ArchetypeClusterState.ProcessWakeRequest, TransitionWakePendingToActive
  on_violation: sleeping cluster with dirty writes never wakes → entity changes never dispatched to systems

### DM-02: SleepingClusterCount consistency `[fatal]`
  invariant SleepingClusterCount == |{ C ∈ ActiveClusterIds : SleepStates[C] ∈ {Sleeping, WakePending} }|
  invariant incremented: Active → Sleeping (DormancySweep, counter ≥ SleepThresholdTicks)
  invariant decremented: WakePending → Active (TransitionWakePendingToActive)
  invariant decremented: RemoveFromActiveList when SleepStates[chunkId] ∈ {Sleeping, WakePending}
  invariant SleepingClusterCount == 0 → all dormancy filtering in OnParallelQueryPrepare is skipped
    (zero overhead fast path)
  scope: ArchetypeClusterState.DormancySweep, TransitionWakePendingToActive, RemoveFromActiveList
  on_violation:
    count too high → false filtering, active clusters skipped by systems
    count too low → sleeping clusters dispatched to systems (wasted CPU)
    count stuck > 0 → dormancy filter overhead even when no clusters are sleeping

### DM-03: Sleep counter overflow guard `[perf]`
  invariant SleepCounters is ushort[] (range [0, 65535])
  invariant SleepThresholdTicks clamped to [0, ushort.MaxValue] via property setter:
    _sleepThresholdTicks = Math.Clamp(value, 0, ushort.MaxValue)
  invariant counter can never exceed ushort.MaxValue because transition fires at SleepThresholdTicks
    (which is ≤ ushort.MaxValue), so the counter is consumed before overflow
  scope: ArchetypeClusterState.SleepThresholdTicks (property), DormancySweep
  on_violation: counter wraps to 0 → cluster oscillates between Active and Sleeping every 65536 ticks
    instead of staying asleep

## Module: Checkerboard Partition (Issue #234)

### CB-01: Exhaustive disjoint partition `[fatal]`
  invariant ∀ filtered cluster set S for a checkerboard system:
    Red ∪ Black == S ∧ Red ∩ Black == ∅
  invariant Red = { C ∈ S : (cellX + cellY + cellZ) % 2 == 0 } where (cellX, cellY, cellZ) = grid.CellKeyToCoords(ClusterCellMap[C])
  invariant Black = { C ∈ S : (cellX + cellY + cellZ) % 2 == 1 }
  note the grid gained a Z axis in #872 step 8; a flat world has cellZ == 0 throughout, so its partition is unchanged.
    The three-dimensional parity is still a proper 2-colouring for 6-neighbour adjacency, which is the property the
    two-phase dispatch actually relies on.
  invariant fallback: ClusterCellMap == null ∨ grid == null → Red = S, Black = ∅
    (non-spatial archetype degenerates to single-phase dispatch)
  invariant unmapped cluster (cellKey < 0) → assigned to Red (fallback)
  scope: TyphonRuntime.SplitCheckerboardClusters
  on_violation:
    non-exhaustive → some clusters never processed → entity state stale
    non-disjoint → some clusters processed twice → double-apply side effects

### CB-02: Two-phase dispatch protocol `[fatal]`
  invariant phase 0 → 1: split into Red/Black, serve Red cluster list
  invariant phase 1 → 2: serve Black cluster list (triggered by re-dispatch after Red completes)
  invariant phase 2 → 0: reset for next tick
  never phase 0 serves Black (Black only served after Red completes)
  scope: TyphonRuntime.OnParallelQueryPrepare (checkerboard section, phase 0→1 / 1→2),
         TyphonRuntime.OnParallelQueryCleanup (phase 2→0 reset + Red→Black re-dispatch)
  note corrected 2026-07-27 — `OnParallelQueryEnd` does not exist in the engine
  on_violation: both phases see same partition → clusters processed twice or zero times

## Module: SetCellTier Validation (Issue #231)

### SC-01: Single-bit SimTier enforcement `[fatal]`
  invariant SetCellTier(cellKey, tier): tier must be SimTier.None or a single-bit flag
  invariant tier ≠ SimTier.None ∧ ¬tier.IsSingleTier() → throw ArgumentException
  invariant TierClusterIndex.Rebuild Debug.Assert validates PopCount(cell.Tier) == 1
    for every non-zero tier byte encountered
  never a CellDescriptor.Tier byte has more than one bit set
  scope: SpatialGrid.SetCellTier, SpatialGrid.SetCellTierMin, TierClusterIndex.Rebuild
  on_violation: multi-bit tier stored → TZCNT at rebuild produces wrong index →
    cluster routed to wrong tier array → system processes wrong cluster set
