# 5 — Systems & the tick loop

Everything so far you drove **by hand**: you opened a transaction, did one thing, let it go. A real simulation or game server doesn't work that way — it runs the *same logic over all its data, continuously, every frame*. That's what the **runtime** gives you: a metronome that beats at a fixed rate, and a graph of **systems** that run over your entities on every beat — in parallel, with the per-tick transaction plumbing handled for you.

This is the chapter where Typhon stops being a database you poke and becomes an engine that runs your world. It's the densest in the guide, and the most important if you're building a server.

> 📌 **The runtime is recommended, but optional.** Everything in chapters 1–4 works without it — if your app is request/response, a batch job, or embeds Typhon inside an existing loop (a game engine's own frame, say), you can keep driving the engine directly through transactions and never declare a single system. The runtime is the *recommended* path when you have continuous, tick-driven logic to run in parallel; it's not a requirement for using Typhon. **If you go that way, read [Embedding without the runtime](embedding-without-the-runtime.md) first** — driving the engine yourself carries exactly one obligation, and skipping it fails silently.

Two ideas carry the whole chapter:

- **A tick is one frame of your simulation.** On each tick the runtime runs your systems once, then advances. 60 ticks a second by default.
- **A system is a unit of logic with declared data access.** You say *what it reads and writes*; the engine works out *what can run at the same time*.

> 📌 **The fixed cadence is for games — the parallelism is for everyone.** Ticks shine in game and simulation development, where a steady real-time beat (60 Hz, say) is exactly the cadence you want to stick to. But that real-time pacing is a *choice*, not a requirement. If you only need Typhon's runtime to **parallelise computation** — a dependency-aware graph of systems fanned across all cores — you can use the very same machinery without pacing to a wall clock: run the loop as fast as the work completes (a high `BaseTickRate`, where each tick is simply "one parallel pass" rather than a clock you wait on). Read the rest of this chapter for the systems-and-parallelism model; treat the fixed-cadence parts as the game-dev specialisation.

---

## 1. The model: tick → systems

Every tick, the runtime walks a fixed structure you declare once at startup:

```
Tick        one frame. A metronome fires at BaseTickRate (default 60 Hz).
 └ Track    a sequential stage. Tracks run one after another, in order.
    └ DAG   a dependency graph of systems. DAGs in a track are independent.
       └ Phase   an ordered bucket inside a DAG (Input → Simulation → …).
          └ System   your logic. Runs once per tick (unless throttled).
```

You'll spend almost all your time at the **system** level. The levels above exist so the engine knows what ordering is mandatory (phases, tracks) and what's free to parallelise (everything else). Three tracks always exist; your code lives on the **Public** track, and the engine owns the two around it (`Engine-Pre`, `Engine-Post`) for its own tick-boundary work.

### The per-tick discipline — handled for you

This is the rule that makes the whole thing safe, and you mostly *don't write it*:

- The runtime opens **one `UnitOfWork` per tick** and flushes it at tick end.
- Each `CallbackSystem` / `QuerySystem` gets its **own `Transaction`**, created on the worker thread that runs it, and **committed and disposed by the scheduler** when the system returns.
- Your system body just *uses* `ctx.Transaction` (or `ctx.Accessor`, §5). It never calls `Commit` or `Dispose`.

> 💡 **Why you must not commit your own transaction.** The scheduler owns the lifecycle so it can enforce the invariants from [ch.3](03-transactions.md) across many systems at once: one consistent snapshot per system, one durability cycle per tick, single-thread affinity (the transaction was made *on this worker* and must die there). If you committed it yourself, you'd be fighting the scheduler for ownership of the tick's atomicity. The deal is simple: you write logic, the engine writes the commit. The one escape hatch — a write that must be durable *right now*, independent of the tick — is `ctx.CreateSideTransaction(...)` ([§6](#6-building-and-running-the-runtime)).

---

## 2. Writing a system

A system is a class: derive from one of three bases, implement `Configure` (declare it) and `Execute` (run it). Three shapes, picked by *what the work looks like*:

| Base | Use it for | Gets `ctx.Entities`? | Transaction |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`CallbackSystem`** | non-entity work: draining input, timers, global state, spawning, cross-entity transfers | no | one per tick |
| **`QuerySystem`** | "do something to every entity in a set" — the workhorse | yes (a View) | one (or one per chunk, parallel) |
| **`PipelineSystem`** | bulk data-parallel work that isn't per-entity (SIMD sweeps, reductions) | no | none — separate access model |

Most simulation logic is `QuerySystem`. `CallbackSystem` is for the edges (input in, render out). `PipelineSystem` is advanced and rare — reach for it only when the per-tick transactional model is in your way.

### A CallbackSystem — spawn new characters

```csharp
internal sealed class SpawnSystem : CallbackSystem
{
    private int _next;

    protected override void Configure(SystemBuilder b) => b
        .Name("Spawn")
        .Phase(Phase.Input)
        .Writes<Transform>().Writes<Bounds>().Writes<Ham>().Writes<Faction>().Writes<Wallet>().Writes<Intent>();

    protected override void Execute(TickContext ctx)
    {
        if (ctx.TickNumber == 0 || ctx.TickNumber % 30 != 0) return;   // periodic spawn
        int i = _next++;
        float x = 100f + (i * 37 % 800), y = 100f + (i * 53 % 800);
        ctx.Transaction.Spawn<Character>(
            Character.Transform.Set(new Transform { Pos = new Point2F { X = x, Y = y }, Vel = new Point2F { X = 4f, Y = 2f } }),
            Character.Bounds.Set(new Bounds { Box = new AABB2F { MinX = x, MaxX = x, MinY = y, MaxY = y } }),
            Character.Ham.Set(new Ham { Health = 50, MaxHealth = 100, Action = 50, MaxAction = 100, Mind = 50, MaxMind = 100 }),
            Character.Faction.Set(new Faction { Value = i % 3 }),
            Character.Wallet.Set(new Wallet { Credits = 100 }),
            Character.Intent.Set(new Intent()));
        // no Commit — the scheduler commits this system's transaction
    }
}
```

### A QuerySystem — move every character

`QuerySystem` needs an **input View** — a live `EcsView` ([ch.4](04-querying.md)) that supplies the entity set. You create it once, hold it, and hand the system a factory:

```csharp
internal sealed class MoveSystem : QuerySystem
{
    private const float World = 1000f;
    private readonly EcsView<Character> _characters;
    public MoveSystem(EcsView<Character> characters) { _characters = characters; }

    protected override void Configure(SystemBuilder b) => b
        .Name("Move")
        .Phase(Phase.Simulation)
        .Input(() => _characters)
        .Parallel()                       // fan across workers (§5)
        .Writes<Transform>();             // declared access (§3)

    protected override void Execute(TickContext ctx)
    {
        foreach (EntityId id in ctx.Entities)             // the filtered set for this chunk
        {
            var e = ctx.Accessor.OpenMut(id);             // per-worker accessor (§5)
            ref var t = ref e.Write(Character.Transform);
            t.Pos = new Point2F { X = Wrap(t.Pos.X + t.Vel.X * ctx.DeltaTime),
                                  Y = Wrap(t.Pos.Y + t.Vel.Y * ctx.DeltaTime) };
        }
    }

    private static float Wrap(float v) => v < 0f ? v + World : (v > World ? v - World : v);
}
```

`ctx.Entities` is the system's input — the View's entities (or just the *changed* ones, when the system declares a change filter). `ctx.DeltaTime` is seconds since the last tick: multiply rates by it and your simulation runs at the same speed regardless of tick rate.

> 💡 **Why a class, and why declare a View up front?** The class isn't ceremony — `Configure` is where you hand the engine the metadata it needs *before the first tick*: the input set, the access set, the ordering. With that in hand the engine builds the parallel schedule once and never re-derives it. (There's also a terser lambda form — `dag.QuerySystem("name", ctx => …, input: () => view)` — fine for a trivial system, but it can't carry `Reads`/`Writes`, so you lose automatic ordering. Prefer the class form for anything real.)

---

## 3. Declaring access — the engine schedules for you

This is the part that earns the runtime its keep. In `Configure` you declare what each system touches:

```csharp
b.Reads<Faction>()         // I read Faction
 .Writes<Transform>()      // I write Transform
 .ReadsResource("Grid")    // I read a named non-component resource
 .WritesEvents(fullQueue)  // I publish to an event queue
```

From those declarations across *all* systems in a DAG, the engine **derives the execution graph** and **rejects unsafe schedules at build time** — before a single tick runs. Two systems that write the same component in the same phase, with no ordering between them, is a hard error, not a race you discover in production.

The read variants are the interesting part, because they answer *"which version of the data do I want?"*:

| Declaration | Meaning | Effect on ordering |
|---|---|---|
| `Reads<T>` | I read T, and no one writes it this phase | error if a same-phase writer exists — pick one of the two below |
| `ReadsFresh<T>` | I want **this tick's** value | ordered **after** the writer (writer → me) |
| `ReadsSnapshot<T>` | **last tick's** value is fine | ordered **before** the writer — so we can run **concurrently** |

> 💡 **Why three kinds of read?** Because "do I need the freshest value?" is a real design choice with a real cost. `ReadsFresh` is correctness when you depend on this tick's write — but it serialises you behind the writer. `ReadsSnapshot` says *"yesterday's value is good enough"* — and that one word lets the engine run your reader **alongside** the writer instead of after it, which is often the difference between a tick fitting in budget and not. One restriction: `ReadsSnapshot<T>` only applies to a **Versioned** `T` — SingleVersion and Transient have no revision history to hand out a stale-but-consistent copy of, and the engine rejects the declaration at `Build()` time if you try (rule CM-04 / `runtime-scheduling.md` AC-05).
>
> Our shard's `Transform` is SingleVersion ([ch.2](02-modeling.md)), so a system can't `ReadsSnapshot<Transform>` — SV keeps no revision history to hand out a stale-but-consistent copy of. `BoundsSyncSystem`, which must see *this tick's* positions to keep the spatial index honest, therefore declares `ReadsFresh<Transform>` and is ordered behind `Move`. `RegenSystem` sidesteps the question entirely: it never touches `Transform` — it only writes `Ham` — so it has **no declared conflict** with `MoveSystem` and runs alongside it for free.

```csharp
internal sealed class RegenSystem : QuerySystem
{
    private readonly EcsView<Character> _characters;
    public RegenSystem(EcsView<Character> characters) { _characters = characters; }

    protected override void Configure(SystemBuilder b) => b
        .Name("Regen")
        .Phase(Phase.Simulation)
        .Input(() => _characters)
        .Parallel()
        .Writes<Ham>();                   // SingleVersion write → lock-free per-worker accessor (see §5)

    protected override void Execute(TickContext ctx)
    {
        foreach (EntityId id in ctx.Entities)
        {
            var e = ctx.Accessor.OpenMut(id);
            ref var h = ref e.Write(Character.Ham);
            h.Health = Math.Min(h.MaxHealth, h.Health + 1);
            h.Action = Math.Min(h.MaxAction, h.Action + 2);   // Action recovers fastest
            h.Mind   = Math.Min(h.MaxMind,   h.Mind + 1);
        }
    }
}
```

Beyond components, you can declare **resources** (`ReadsResource`/`WritesResource` — for shared non-component state like a spatial grid handle) and **events** (`WritesEvents`/`ReadsEvents` — typed queues that create a producer→consumer edge). All of it feeds the same one-time graph derivation.

---

## 4. Ordering: phases and explicit edges

Access declarations handle *data* ordering. For *structural* ordering you have two tools:

- **Phases** — a DAG-local total order. Everything in `Input` finishes before anything in `Simulation` starts. Typhon ships `Input`, `Simulation`, `Output`, `Cleanup`; you can define your own. Use phases for coarse "all input before all simulation before all rendering" structure.
- **`After` / `Before` / `AfterAll`** — an explicit edge between two named systems in the same DAG. Use it to disambiguate two writers, or to force a specific order the access model can't infer.

You declare the phase list when you create the DAG, and the engine slots each system into its phase:

```csharp
schedule.PublicTrack
    .DeclareDag("Sim")
    .Phases(Phase.Input, Phase.Simulation)
    .Add(new SpawnSystem())                  // Phase.Input
    .Add(new MoveSystem(characters))          // Phase.Simulation
    .Add(new BoundsSyncSystem(characters))    // Phase.Simulation — after Move (keeps the spatial index coherent)
    .Add(new RegenSystem(characters))         // Phase.Simulation — parallel with Move
    .Add(new WanderSystem(characters))        // Phase.Simulation — after Move (steers next tick's velocity)
    .Add(new TradeSystem());                 // Phase.Simulation — the Versioned economy, at event cadence
```

`BoundsSyncSystem` is a cluster-native `QuerySystem` that mirrors each moved position into the spatial `Bounds` box through the `WriteSpatial` barrier ([ch.2 §5](02-modeling.md#5-spatial--querying-by-geometry)). It declares `.After("Move").ReadsFresh<Transform>().Writes<Bounds>()`, so it runs once Move has moved everything this tick.

> 💡 **Phases are a contract, not a barrier wall.** Two systems in the same phase run concurrently *unless* their access declarations conflict. Two systems in adjacent phases only serialise where they actually touch the same data — a phase-N+1 system with no conflict against a phase-N system can overlap it. So you get the readability of "input, then simulate, then render" without paying for a hard stop between every stage. Order what must be ordered; let the engine parallelise the rest.

---

## 5. Running in parallel

A `QuerySystem` with `.Parallel()` is **chunked across the worker pool**: the engine splits the entity set into chunks and runs your `Execute` on several workers at once, each handling a slice of `ctx.Entities`. You write the *same* single-threaded body — the engine fans it out.

How a parallel system touches data depends on what it **writes**:

- **Non-Versioned writes (SingleVersion / Transient)** — the fast path. Each worker gets a per-worker **`ctx.Accessor`** (an `EntityAccessor`) with warm caches and **zero per-entity locking**, riding on a single frozen snapshot (a `PointInTimeAccessor`). This is how `MoveSystem` and `RegenSystem` write `Transform` and `Ham` (both SV) across all cores with no contention.
- **Versioned writes** — declare `.WritesVersioned()`. The engine falls back to a **per-chunk `Transaction`** (via `ctx.Transaction`) because Versioned writes need the full MVCC machinery. Correct, but heavier — which is exactly why hot, overwrite-often data like position is usually SingleVersion ([ch.2](02-modeling.md)).

```csharp
b.Input(() => _characters).Parallel()
 .Writes<Transform>();                       // SV write → ctx.Accessor, lock-free

b.Input(() => _characters).Parallel().WritesVersioned()
 .Writes<Wallet>();                          // Versioned write → per-chunk ctx.Transaction
```

> 💡 **A cross-entity transfer wants a `CallbackSystem`, not a parallel one.** `ctx.Accessor` refuses a Versioned write outright, and even `.WritesVersioned()` gives each *chunk* its own transaction — fine for "update each entity independently", wrong for "move credits from A to B", where both sides must land in the **same** transaction to be atomic. That is why the sample's `TradeSystem` is a serial `CallbackSystem` driving `ctx.Transaction`, and why it fires **at event cadence** (`if (ctx.TickNumber % 10 != 0) return;`) instead of every tick. A Versioned write costs roughly 6x a SingleVersion one — so the economy beats on a slower drum while movement, HAM and AI run hot every tick. That one decision is often the difference between a tick loop that fits its budget and one that does not.

> 💡 **The zero-lock read is the whole point.** Under the hood, parallel reads share one `PointInTimeAccessor` — a single frozen TSN that every worker reads against without taking a single per-entity lock, because [snapshot isolation](03-transactions.md) guarantees the snapshot can't move under them. That's how "iterate a million entities across every core at one consistent instant" is a normal operation here, not a feat. It only works because nobody is mutating the versions those readers can see — the same property you bought with *Versioned* storage.

Two knobs worth knowing (both in `RuntimeOptions`):

- **`ParallelQueryMinChunkSize`** (default 64) — the floor on entities per chunk. Small sets still run the parallel path, just as one chunk. Stops tiny populations from spawning a chunk per worker for no gain.
- **`ChunksPerWorker`** (per-system, via `b.ChunksPerWorker(f)`) — oversubscription. Above 1.0, fast workers can steal extra chunks while a slow one finishes — smooths out an uneven workload.

---

## 6. Building and running the runtime

`TyphonRuntime.Create` takes your engine ([ch.1](01-first-app.md)), a schedule-building lambda, and options. Then `Start()` spins up the worker pool and the metronome; the tick loop runs until you `Shutdown()`.

```csharp
// engine `dbe` already built + schema registered (ch.1–2)

// One long-lived input View for the entity systems:
EcsView<Character> characters;
using (var tx = dbe.CreateQuickTransaction())
    characters = tx.Query<Character>().ToView();

using var runtime = TyphonRuntime.Create(dbe, schedule =>
{
    schedule.PublicTrack
        .DeclareDag("Sim")
        .Phases(Phase.Input, Phase.Simulation)
        .Add(new SpawnSystem())
        .Add(new MoveSystem(characters))
        .Add(new BoundsSyncSystem(characters))   // ch.2's WriteSpatial, kept coherent every tick
        .Add(new RegenSystem(characters))
        .Add(new WanderSystem(characters))
        .Add(new TradeSystem());
}, new RuntimeOptions
{
    BaseTickRate = 60,    // ticks per second
    WorkerCount  = -1,    // auto: max(1, CPUs - 4); set 1 for serial debugging
});

runtime.Start();
// … the simulation is now running on its own threads …
runtime.Shutdown();      // fires OnShutdown, stops workers cleanly
```

The runtime owns its threads — there is no "run one tick" call you drive in a loop. You `Start`, the world ticks itself, and you observe it (`runtime.CurrentTickNumber`, telemetry) or feed it (input queues, tool commands) from the outside.

**Lifecycle hooks** for the two moments that need special handling:

```csharp
runtime.OnFirstTick += ctx => { /* rebuild transient state after a crash restart */ };
runtime.OnShutdown  += ctx => { /* persist final state — ctx has an Immediate-durable tx */ };
```

- `OnFirstTick` fires once, with a real transaction — use it to repair `Transient` state that didn't survive a restart.
- `OnShutdown` fires during `Shutdown()`, with a dedicated **`Immediate`-durability** transaction so your final save is on disk before the process exits.

> 💡 **Side transactions — when a write can't wait for tick end.** The per-tick UoW commits at tick end, which is perfect for simulation state but wrong for a purchase or a trade: those must be durable the instant they happen. `ctx.CreateSideTransaction(DurabilityMode.Immediate)` gives you a transaction you own and dispose, committing independently of the tick. Use it for the rare economy-critical write; let everything else ride the tick.

---

## 7. Spending the tick where it matters

Everything so far runs *every system over every entity, every tick*. That's the right default, and it stops being affordable the moment your world is bigger than your screen. A shard full of characters has a handful near the player who need full-fidelity AI at 60 Hz, a ring beyond them who only need to keep moving, and a long tail out in the fields that nobody is looking at. Running all three at the same rate is one of the most common reasons a tick loop stops fitting its budget.

Typhon gives you four mechanisms for this, and they're worth learning **in order**, because each one exists to fix what the previous one leaves on the table. They all ride on the spatial grid you configured back in [ch.2 §5](02-modeling.md#5-spatial--querying-by-geometry), and they all work at **cluster** granularity — never per entity, which is the whole point. A per-entity "am I near the player?" check every tick is itself O(N), and would cost more than the work it skips.

### Step one: tier the world

You classify the world coarsely — one **`SimTier`** per grid cell, once per tick — and every system downstream restricts itself to matching cells automatically. There are four tiers, `Tier0` (nearest) through `Tier3`, plus the combinations `Near` (`Tier0 | Tier1`) and `Active` (everything but `Tier3`).

Assignment is *your* policy, not the engine's, because only you know what "important" means in your game. Write it as a `CallbackSystem` in `Phase.Input`, so it lands before anything that filters on it:

```csharp
internal sealed class TierAssignment : CallbackSystem
{
    private readonly Camera _camera;               // your own type — Typhon has no opinion about what a camera is
    public TierAssignment(Camera camera) { _camera = camera; }

    protected override void Configure(SystemBuilder b) => b
        .Name("TierAssignment")
        .Phase(Phase.Input)                        // before every Simulation system that filters on tier
        .Priority(SystemPriority.Critical);        // never shed — the tiers have to exist

    protected override void Execute(TickContext ctx)
    {
        var grid = ctx.SpatialGrid;
        if (!grid.IsValid) return;                 // no grid configured — nothing to tier

        grid.ResetAllTiers(SimTier.Tier3);         // everything is background until proven otherwise
        Promote(grid, _camera.X, _camera.Y, 120f, SimTier.Tier0);   // full fidelity, close in
        Promote(grid, _camera.X, _camera.Y, 300f, SimTier.Tier1);   // keep moving, no combat AI
    }

    private static void Promote(SpatialGridAccessor grid, float x, float y, float r, SimTier tier) =>
        grid.SetTierInAABB(x - r, y - r, 0f, x + r, y + r, 0f, tier);   // six floats: min/max on all three axes
}
```

Two things about that call are worth pausing on. It takes **six** floats, not four — Typhon's grid is 3D even when your world isn't, and our shard is a `Flat` world whose Z axis is exactly one cell deep, so `0f` to `0f` covers all of it. And it uses **promote-only** semantics: a cell already at a better tier is left alone. That's what lets you call it once per observer in a loop and get the union for free, which is what you want on a server with many players.

Now a system opts in. The AI work is the expensive part, so it gets the tightest tier:

```csharp
b.Name("CombatAi").Phase(Phase.Simulation)
 .Input(() => _characters).Parallel()
 .Tier(SimTier.Tier0)                  // dispatch only against clusters in Tier 0 cells
 .Writes<Intent>();
```

The filter runs against a per-archetype list of active clusters grouped by tier, rebuilt at tick start and **skipped entirely** when neither the grid's tier assignment nor the archetype's cluster set changed since last tick — a camera-stationary tick pays two integer compares. So `CombatAi` never scans the rest of the archetype to find out what to skip; the clusters it doesn't want were never in its dispatch list. The same scoping applies to a View, via `view.WithTier(SimTier.Tier0)`, if you want a published output set narrowed the same way.

There's a feedback signal too. `ctx.TierBudgetMetrics` reports what each tier cost in wall-clock and entities *last* tick, so a `TierAssignment` system can shrink its own rings when it's over budget instead of you guessing radii. It reads all-zero on the very first tick — guard `BudgetMs == 0` before you divide by it.

### Step two: amortise the tiers you kept

Tiering gave you a set of clusters you don't run at all. But `Tier3` is most of your world, and "not at all" is usually too strong — background characters should still drift towards their destinations, just not sixty times a second.

That's `CellAmortize(N)`: process `1/N` of the tier's clusters per tick, rotating buckets by tick number. It **requires** a non-`All` tier, since amortising everything would just be a slower simulation.

```csharp
b.Name("IdleDrift").Phase(Phase.Simulation)
 .Input(() => _characters).Parallel()
 .Tier(SimTier.Tier3).CellAmortize(60)   // each Tier 3 cluster gets one tick in sixty
 .Writes<Transform>();
```

The trap is in the arithmetic, not the API. If the body keeps multiplying by `ctx.DeltaTime`, your background characters now move at one sixtieth speed. Use **`ctx.AmortizedDeltaTime`**, which is `DeltaTime × N` — the time that actually elapsed since this cluster's last turn:

```csharp
t.Pos = new Point2F { X = t.Pos.X + t.Vel.X * ctx.AmortizedDeltaTime, Y = … };
```

And note what's being skipped: whole clusters, not entities. This is not an entity-id modulo — the fifty-nine sixtieths you skip in a tick are never iterated at all.

### Step three: let the quiet clusters sleep

Amortisation still visits every cluster eventually, on a fixed rotation, whether or not anything in it changed. A cluster of characters standing still in an empty field gets its turn every sixtieth tick, does nothing, and costs you a dispatch anyway.

**Dormancy** closes that gap. Each cluster carries a sleep counter that increments on every tick its dirty region stays clean, and resets the instant a write lands. Past a threshold the cluster flips to `Sleeping` and is dropped from *every* system's dispatch list for that archetype — tier-filtered or not, amortised or not — at no per-entity cost. A write wakes it, with a bounded one tick of latency: the wake is recorded on a thread-local list during parallel execution (touching shared sleep state inline would race), drained at the tick fence, and promoted before any system dispatches next tick. An optional heartbeat wakes sleepers on a staggered schedule anyway, if you want a periodic idle re-check.

Two honest caveats before you reach for it.

First, **it is not wired to a public API yet.** The thresholds live on the archetype's internal cluster state, so turning dormancy on today needs the same `InternalsVisibleTo` access the engine's own sample hosts build under. Only the `ClusterSleepState` enum is public.

Second, and more likely to surprise you: **`WriteSpatial` deliberately doesn't mark a slot dirty.** That's the barrier `BoundsSyncSystem` uses to keep the spatial index honest, and it is the *high-frequency* write on a moving entity — so a cluster whose entities only ever move through the spatial barrier can fall asleep, and stay asleep, while still moving. Our shard is safe by accident: `MoveSystem` writes `Transform` through `ctx.Accessor.OpenMut(id).Write(...)`, which does mark dirty, so movement keeps its own clusters awake. If your movement path is *only* the spatial barrier, dormancy will quietly stop dispatching it.

### Step four: checkerboard the systems that read their neighbours

Everything above narrows *which* clusters run. This last one is about a system whose body reaches outside the cluster it was handed.

Say you add a scent or influence field, where each cell's value blends with the values of the cells around it. Under `.Parallel()` two adjacent cells land on two workers at the same instant and race on the boundary they share. The usual escape is to make the system single-threaded, which is exactly backwards — a full-grid diffusion pass is often the most expensive thing in your tick, and the one you most want fanned out.

`Checkerboard()` colours every cell from the parity of its grid coordinates, `(x + y + z) % 2`, and dispatches Red first, then Black, as two sequential phases inside one DAG node:

```csharp
b.Name("ScentDiffuse").Phase(Phase.Simulation)
 .Input(() => _characters).Parallel()   // required — Checkerboard without Parallel throws at Build()
 .Tier(SimTier.Near).Checkerboard()
 .Writes<Scent>();                      // Scent being a new component you added to Character
```

Your `Execute` runs **twice** per tick, with `ctx.Entities` scoped to that phase's clusters. No two face-sharing cells ever share a colour, so while you're processing a Red cell no worker is touching any of its six orthogonal neighbours. Downstream systems see one node and wait for both phases; nothing else in the DAG needs to know dispatch happened twice.

The three-axis parity is the part to remember. In our flat shard `z` is `0` everywhere and the split reduces to the familiar two-dimensional chequerboard — but in a 3D world the `z` term is what keeps a cell and the cell stacked directly above it in opposite colours. Drop it and the safety property quietly fails on one axis out of three.

The limit is stated in the colouring itself: this protects **face adjacency only**. Diagonal neighbours share a colour, so a system that reaches diagonally is not protected by a two-phase split. It does compose cleanly with everything above — the colouring is computed over whatever cluster set the tier filter and dormancy already produced.

> 💡 **All four compose, and the price is one tick of staleness.** A system can be tier-filtered, amortised and checkerboard-dispatched at once, with dormancy filtering underneath. The uniform trade is latency at the boundaries: a tier change, a cluster migration, or a wake all take effect at the *next* tick's dispatch, never the current one. That's the same one-tick rule the spatial index itself follows ([ch.2 §5](02-modeling.md#5-spatial--querying-by-geometry)), and it's why none of this needs a lock.

For the full treatment — every option, every guarantee, and the exact throw conditions — see [Tiered Simulation Dispatch](../feature-set/Spatial/tiered-simulation-dispatch.md), [Cluster Dormancy](../feature-set/Spatial/cluster-dormancy.md) and [Checkerboard Dispatch](../feature-set/Spatial/checkerboard-dispatch.md). If the grid underneath is itself mis-sized none of this saves you, and that's a different job: [Tuning the Spatial Grid](../feature-set/Spatial/spatial-tuning.md), measured with [Reading Spatial Telemetry](../feature-set/Spatial/spatial-telemetry.md).

## 8. Staying real-time under load

A fixed tick rate is a promise: 60 ticks a second means each tick has ~16 ms. When a tick starts overrunning that budget, the runtime would rather **degrade gracefully** than let latency spiral. You shape that degradation with two per-system declarations:

- **`Priority`** — `Critical` (never throttled or shed), `High`, `Normal`, `Low` (shed first).
- **`TickDivisor` / `ThrottledTickDivisor`** — run every Nth tick (normally / under load), and **`CanShed`** — may be skipped entirely under severe load.

```csharp
b.Name("Decals").Priority(SystemPriority.Low).CanShed(true).TickDivisor(2);
```

Under sustained overrun the engine escalates through a sticky chain — throttle low-priority systems, cap per-system entity budgets, slow the tick rate (down to a configurable floor), and finally fire **`OnCriticalOverload`** so *you* decide the last resort (shed work, split the world, refuse connections). The internals are the in-depth reference's job ([10-runtime](../in-depth-overview/10-runtime.md)); what you need to know to *use* it is: **set honest priorities, mark sheddable work sheddable, and the runtime keeps the critical path real-time when the machine can't keep up.**

> ⚠️ Overload response is about *surviving spikes*, not papering over a too-heavy design. If `Critical` systems alone blow the budget, no amount of shedding helps — that's a modeling/parallelism problem, not a tuning one.

## 🧭 What's next

You can now run logic over your world every tick, in parallel, in real time. That's the engine doing its job. The last chapter is about *operating* it:

- **[Chapter 6 — Operating & going deeper](06-operating.md):** observing a running engine (telemetry, the profiler), resource budgets, error-handling ground rules, and the map into the in-depth reference for when you outgrow this guide.
