# Index Diagnostics & Consistency Checking
> Always-on contention counters plus an on-demand structural walk for troubleshooting B+Tree indexes.

**Status:** ✅ Implemented · **Visibility:** Internal · **Category:** [Indexing](./README.md)

## 🎯 What it solves

Lock-free index concurrency ([OLC](./olc-concurrency.md)) trades a simple whole-tree lock for retry-driven
correctness: readers and writers can race, restart, and fall back to a slower path under contention. When a
workload feels slower than expected, or a stress run produces a result you don't trust, "is this index
contended?" and "is this index's structure actually sound?" are the two questions you need answered without
attaching a profiler or stepping through engine internals. Typhon answers both cheaply: contention counters
update unconditionally as part of every index operation, and a full structural walk is one shell command away.

## ⚙️ How it works (in brief)

Every B+Tree index instance carries a handful of `long` counters — bumped only on the retry/fallback/structural
paths (version-check failures, optimistic→pessimistic fallbacks, splits, merges) — so the steady-state lookup
and insert paths pay nothing extra. They give a coarse signal of how much retry/fallback traffic an index is
absorbing under concurrent load. Separately, `tsh`'s `btree-validate` command walks an index from root to leaf
under an epoch guard, checking: separator/HighKey bounds between parent and child, within-node key ordering
(items strictly ascending inside each node), descent/chain agreement (leaves reachable by root descent must
equal leaves reachable via the leaf chain), `EntryCount` consistency, and B-link sibling linkage. Multiple
violation classes can surface in one call — useful after a stress run, a crash-recovery rebuild, or whenever
you suspect corruption rather than just contention.

## 💻 Usage

Inspect an index and validate its structure from the `tsh` shell:

```
tsh> open game.typhon
tsh> load-schema bin/Game.Components.dll

tsh> btree Player.Name
  B+Tree: Player.Name (unique)
  ──────────────────────────────────────
  Total nodes:     128
  Chunk capacity:  512
  Fill factor:     25.0%
  Node size:       356 bytes

tsh> btree-validate Player.Name
  Validating B+Tree Player.Name...
  Validation passed
```

`Player.Name` is a `String64` key, so it reports the `String64BTree` node size of **356 bytes**. A numeric-keyed index reports **256**. See [B+Tree Node Layout & Tuning](./btree-node-layout-tuning.md).

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `btree <Component.Field>` | Node count, chunk capacity, fill factor, node size |
| `btree-dump <Component.Field> [--level N \| --chunk N]` | Raw node/chunk inspection |
| `btree-validate <Component.Field>` | Full structural walk; reports pass or the first violation |

The contention counters (`OptimisticRestarts`, `PessimisticRestarts`, `PessimisticFallbacks`, `SplitCount`, `MergeCount`, …) aren't
wired to a `tsh` command yet — today they're consumed by the engine's own stress-test and benchmark harnesses,
which read them straight off the index instance to confirm a concurrent workload actually exercised the
retry/fallback paths it was meant to:

```csharp
// Engine-internal / stress-harness code (InternalsVisibleTo), not part of the public Typhon.Engine surface.
TestContext.Out.WriteLine(
    $"OptRestarts={tree.OptimisticRestarts} PessRestarts={tree.PessimisticRestarts} Fallbacks={tree.PessimisticFallbacks} " +
    $"WriteLockFails={tree.WriteLockFailures} Splits={tree.SplitCount} Merges={tree.MergeCount} " +
    $"ContentionSplits={tree.ContentionSplitCount} Deferred={tree.DeferredNodeCount} " +
    $"RetryExits=[{tree.DescribeInsertRetryExits()}]");
```

## ⚠️ Guarantees & limits

- Counters are always-on and incremented unconditionally — no flag to enable, nothing to forget to turn off —
  but they only move on retry/fallback/structural paths, so they add no cost to the steady-state hot path.
- Counters are per-index-instance and process-lifetime; they reset to zero on engine restart and are not
  persisted, checkpointed, or aggregated across indexes.
- `btree-validate` is read-only and safe to run against a live database; it runs under an epoch guard so it
  observes a consistent epoch, but it is a point-in-time walk, not a continuous monitor.
- `btree-validate` checks structural soundness (separator/HighKey bounds, within-node key ordering, descent/chain
  agreement, `EntryCount` consistency, B-link sibling linkage) — it does not check that index entries match the
  component data they're supposed to reference.
- The contention counters and the descent-trace forensic hook used for deep OLC bug investigation are
  engine-internal; they require `InternalsVisibleTo` access (as `tsh`, the test suite, and benchmarks have) and
  are not part of the stable public `Typhon.Engine` API.

## 🧪 Tests

- [OlcBTreeStressTests](https://github.com/Log2n-io/Typhon/blob/main/test/Typhon.Engine.Tests/Data/OlcBTreeStressTests.cs) — `LogDiagnostics`/`tree.ResetDiagnostics()`: reads `OptimisticRestarts`/`PessimisticRestarts`/`PessimisticFallbacks`/`SplitCount`/`MergeCount`/`ContentionSplitCount` and calls `DescribeInsertRetryExits()` straight off a stressed tree instance, the same counters this feature documents
- [BTreeTests](https://github.com/Log2n-io/Typhon/blob/main/test/Typhon.Engine.Tests/Data/BTreeTests.cs) — pervasive `tree.CheckConsistency(...)` calls exercise the same structural walk (key ordering, parent/child linkage, B-link sibling chaining) that `tsh btree-validate` runs via `DiagnosticCommandExecutor`
