# Reading Spatial Telemetry
> Thirty-two counters that say which spatial parameter is wrong, and the ten of them a metrics pipeline can actually see.

**Status:** ✅ Implemented · **Visibility:** Public · **Level:** 🟣 Advanced · **Category:** [Spatial](./README.md)

## 🎯 What it solves

The spatial partition is not self-configuring, and its failure mode is quiet. A cell size that is slightly wrong does
not throw; it spends the re-clustering budget every tick and hands your queries looser cluster boxes than it started
with. [Tuning the Spatial Grid](./spatial-tuning.md) lists the parameters. This page is the other half: the
counters that tell you *which* of them to change, so tuning is a measurement rather than a guess.

`SpatialMigrationTelemetry` carries **32 public members**, read through `DatabaseEngine.GetSpatialTelemetry(archetypeId)`
for one archetype or `GetSpatialTelemetryTotal()` for the engine. Each one is paired below with the parameter it moves.

> ⚠️ **Most of these counters are not exported today, and this is the first thing to know about them.** Exactly **ten**
> reach OpenTelemetry, under `typhon.ecs.spatial.*` ([`EcsMetricsExporter.cs`](https://github.com/Log2n-io/Typhon/blob/main/src/Typhon.Engine/Observability/public/EcsMetricsExporter.cs)).
> The other **22 are API-only** — including `RelocationsThrottled`, `RepairUnitsRefused`, `RepairQueueDepth` and
> `MeasuredNsPerEntity`, which are the four this page's three worked readings are built on, and the four the tuning page
> names as the acceptance test before you ship. **No Workbench panel shows spatial partitioning telemetry at all**, and
> nothing in `tools/` reads either accessor. So the loop below is real, but today you close it from your own tick loop —
> log the struct, expose it on your own health endpoint, or read it in a debugger. Nothing else will show it to you.
> `GetSpatialGridOccupancy()` is API-only on the same terms.

## ⚙️ How it works (in brief)

Every counter is a plain field on the archetype's cluster state, written by the tick fence and read without a lock. The
fence is what produces them, so they advance whether the [runtime](../../guide/05-systems.md) is ticking or you call
`dbe.WriteTickFence(n)` yourself from a bare transaction — the engine's own drift, throttle and repair fixtures are
driven exactly that second way.

**There are two clocks, deliberately.** The `...Count` / `...Ms` members describe the **most recently completed tick**
and are reset at the top of every fence. The `Total...` members and `RepairQueueEvicted` only grow. A scrape every few
seconds that reads a per-tick member samples one arbitrary tick out of hundreds and tells you almost nothing; read the
per-tick members from inside the tick loop, and differentiate the cumulative ones for a rate. `RepairQueueDepth` is
neither — it is a **level**, and persists across ticks.

**Zero means zero, never "unknown."** An archetype with no cluster state, an out-of-range id, and a tick in which
nothing happened all report zero, so a flat line is only informative once you know a fence ran.

## 💻 Usage

Read the snapshot after the fence, before the next tick:

```csharp
var t = dbe.GetSpatialTelemetry(Archetype<Ant>.Metadata.ArchetypeId);   // or dbe.GetSpatialTelemetryTotal()

// The two acceptance numbers. Both must settle at zero before you ship (see the tuning page).
if (t.RelocationsThrottled > 0 || (t.RepairUnitsRefused > 0 && t.RepairUnitCount == 0))
{
    _log.SpatialBudgetStarved(t.RelocationsThrottled, t.RepairUnitsRefused, t.MeasuredNsPerEntity);
}
```

Reading is allocation-free and never throws. The snapshot is taken field by field without a lock, so a read racing the
fence can mix values from either side of it.

### Cell crossings — the inter-cell loop

| Counter | Clock | Tunes | OTel |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MigrationCount` | last tick | `CellSize` | `typhon.ecs.spatial.migrations` |
| `HysteresisAbsorbedCount` | last tick | `MigrationHysteresisRatio` | `…spatial.hysteresis_absorbed` |
| `TotalMigrations` | cumulative | — differentiate for a rate | `…spatial.migrations_total` |
| `TotalHysteresisAbsorbed` | cumulative | — differentiate for a rate | `…spatial.hysteresis_absorbed_total` |
| `MigrationExecuteMs` | last tick | — see the note below | `…spatial.migration_duration_ms` |
| `MigrationTotalMs` | last tick | the honest per-migration cost | — |
| `ActiveClusterCount` | level | `CellSize` — the denominator for every ratio here | `…spatial.active_clusters` |

**Use `MigrationTotalMs`, not `MigrationExecuteMs`, for cost per entity.** The exported one brackets the migrant loop
alone, which merely *stages* the index and `EntityMap` updates; the descent that applies them happens in a later phase.
The secondary index was measured at roughly half of a migration's cost, so the exported field under-reports by about
half — and it is the one your dashboard gets. Both are CPU-milliseconds summed across workers, not wall-clock span.

### Intra-cell drift and relocation

| Counter | Clock | Tunes | OTel |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ClustersScanned` | last tick | the dirty gate — clusters *written*, not clusters that exist | `…spatial.clusters_scanned` |
| `SlotsScanned` | last tick | the refresh's own cost, in the unit that scales with the world | — |
| `DriftersDetected` | last tick | `ClusterTargetExtentRatio` | `…spatial.drifters_detected` |
| `DriftAbsorbedCount` | last tick | `ClusterDriftMarginRatio` | `…spatial.drift_absorbed` |
| `RelocationsThrottled` | last tick | `ReclusterBudgetMs` | — |
| `RelocationsSuperseded` | last tick | nothing — informational | — |
| `DriftersUnplaced` | last tick | `CellSize` — every cluster in the cell was full | — |

Over one tick these close: `DriftersDetected = admitted + RelocationsThrottled + RelocationsSuperseded +
DriftersUnplaced`. That identity is what makes "a drifter is never both absorbed and throttled" checkable rather than
merely asserted, and it is the arithmetic you use to find out *where* detected work went.

`SlotsScanned` should sit near the occupied-slot count of the clusters written this tick. If it tracks the whole
population instead, the refresh has lost its dirty gate — a defect to report, not a knob to turn.

### Repair — the full re-sort

| Counter | Clock | Tunes | OTel |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ReclusterBudgetUsedMs` | last tick | `ReclusterBudgetMs` — **projected, not measured** | `…spatial.recluster_budget_ms` |
| `RepairedEntityCount` | last tick | what the planner committed to | — |
| `RepairUnitCount` | last tick | units admitted; one unit is one cell's N worst clusters | — |
| `RepairUnitsRefused` | last tick | `ReclusterBudgetMs`, `RepairWorstClustersPerUnit` | — |
| `RepairValveFires` | last tick | `ClusterRepairCriticalExtentRatio`, `ReclusterBudgetMs` | — |
| `RepairQueueDepth` | **level** | `RepairQueueMaxCells` | — |
| `RepairQueueEvicted` | cumulative | `RepairQueueMaxCells` | — |
| `RepairQueueMaintenanceMs` | last tick | `RepairAgingRatePerTick` | — |
| `MeasuredNsPerEntity` | last tick | `RepairNsPerEntity` — the live value that replaced the seed | — |

`ReclusterBudgetUsedMs` is a **projection**, and the difference is the design: a unit is admitted only if the remaining
budget covers its whole cost, so the estimate has to exist before the work does. Reporting elapsed time instead would
report a number that gated nothing. Compare it against your measured tick time to find out whether the cost model is
honest — which is what `MeasuredNsPerEntity` now does automatically, as an exponentially-weighted average clamped to a
band around the configured seed.

### Prep breakdown — profiling, not tuning

`PrepSnapshotMs`, `PrepMaskMs`, `PrepShadowMs`, `PrepZoneMapMs`, `PrepDetectMs`, `PrepThrottleMs`, `PrepPlanMs`,
`PrepPreSizeMs` and `PrepDirtyClusters` split the Prep phase in phase order: snapshot, occupancy mask, index replay,
min/max refresh, crossing detection, budget, repair plan, pre-size. None of them is exported and none maps to a
parameter. They exist because Prep is the largest phase of the fence and the phase-level spans could not say which of
its steps cost anything. Reach for them when you are optimising the engine, not when you are tuning a world.

### Reading 1 — hysteresis is absorbing nothing

**What you see.** `MigrationCount` is a large fraction of the population every tick, and `HysteresisAbsorbedCount` is at
or near zero beside it. Both are exported, so this is the one reading a dashboard can show you unaided.

**What it means.** One of two things, and the absorbed count is what separates them. Either the dead zone is too narrow
to catch entities oscillating around a cell boundary — each one crosses, migrates, crosses back and migrates again — or
your entities are genuinely traversing cells, in which case there is no oscillation to absorb and the margin is
blameless.

**Which knob.** Raise `MigrationHysteresisRatio` first, from its default of a twentieth of the cell towards a tenth. If
absorption stays near zero after that, the margin was never the problem and the cell is too small for how far things
move in a tick: raise `CellSize` instead, back towards 16 to 64 entities per cell.

**What you expect after.** The absorbed count rises and the migration count falls, with their sum roughly unchanged —
that is the margin catching crossings it was previously paying for. If instead both fall together, you changed the cell
size and the world simply crosses fewer boundaries. A high migration rate is not a fault by itself; coherent swarms
measured the highest crossing rate in the benchmark set and were also the best-partitioned case in it.

**One trap in the number.** `HysteresisAbsorbedCount` counts one per absorbed *write* on an archetype using the spatial
write barrier, and one per *slot per tick* on every other archetype, because that producer is a once-per-tick scan. The
two agree at one spatial write per entity per tick and diverge above it. Treat it as a rate signal, not an exact count.

### Reading 2 — repair units refused every tick

**What you see.** `RepairUnitsRefused` sustained above zero while `RepairUnitCount` stays at zero, tick after tick.
Neither is exported, so you will only ever see this from your own code.

**What it means.** The budget cannot afford the smallest unit on offer, so no repair happens at all — not "less repair",
none. A full re-sort cannot be halved: a partly re-sorted cell has paid the cost and banked only part of the benefit, so
the throttle admits whole units and refuses the rest outright. This is the cliff. The arithmetic is unforgiving, and
worth doing by hand once. At the seeded cost of 1 500 ns per entity a 1 ms budget buys about 667 entities, while a
default unit of eight clusters at around 49 occupied slots each is about 392 — so the actuator admits **one unit or
none**, and a slightly pessimistic cost estimate takes you from one to none. Check `MeasuredNsPerEntity`, because the
live figure is what the budget actually spends against: repair measures roughly a microsecond per entity, so budget against
that range rather than against a per-entity figure you assume.

**Which knob.** Raise `ReclusterBudgetMs`, doubling until `RelocationsThrottled` reaches zero, then stop. If you cannot
afford the milliseconds, lower `RepairWorstClustersPerUnit` instead so a unit is smaller and something gets through.
Do **not** set `ReclusterBudgetMs` to zero to make the counter go away: zero disables repair *and* disables throttle
enforcement, so every relocation then runs unmetered, and it measured the worst cluster tightness of any budget tested.

**What you expect after.** `RepairUnitCount` becomes non-zero and `RepairUnitsRefused` falls to zero. Cluster count
*rises* — cells genuinely subdivide instead of each holding one loose box — and query time falls with the tighter
boxes. Persistent `RepairValveFires` after this means degradation is outrunning the budget even so; that valve is the
only budget overshoot the engine permits, and it is meant to bound the condition, not to be your steady state.

### Reading 3 — the repair queue is evicting

**What you see.** `RepairQueueEvicted` growing while `RepairQueueDepth` sits at `RepairQueueMaxCells`. The depth is a
level, so unlike its neighbours it will still be there on the next tick.

**What it means.** More cells are degraded at once than the queue can remember, and candidates are being forgotten. The
queue ranks by degradation, tier weight, cluster count and an ageing term, and evicts by score — so what falls out is
the least urgent, which is the right choice but still a loss. A cell dropped from the queue is not repaired and not
remembered; it must degrade its way back in.

**Which knob.** Raise `RepairQueueMaxCells` above the number of cells your world degrades simultaneously. But treat a
full queue as a symptom before you treat it as a cap: a queue at its cap usually means degradation is being *created*
faster than the budget retires it, and the same reading almost always comes with `RepairUnitsRefused` above zero. Fix
the budget first, then size the queue to what is left. If a specific cell is visibly never serviced while others are,
check that `RepairAgingRatePerTick` is not zero — zero disables ageing, and a permanently outranked cell then starves
for ever.

**What you expect after.** Evictions stop and the depth settles below the cap. The healthy steady state is a depth
comfortably under the cap with a flat eviction count. A depth that falls to zero and stays there is also fine — it means
nothing is degraded enough to nominate.

## ⚠️ Guarantees & limits

- **Ten of thirty-two counters are exported.** The `typhon.ecs.spatial.*` meter publishes eight observable gauges and
  two observable counters, per archetype, tagged by archetype name. Everything else on the struct — including the four
  the readings above depend on — is reachable only through the two accessor calls. Two further gauges,
  `typhon.ecs.open.cellstate_rebuild_ms` and `typhon.ecs.open.cluster_aabb_rebuild_ms`, are engine-wide open timings
  read from `DatabaseEngine`, not from this struct.
- **No Workbench panel presents spatial partitioning telemetry.** The Workbench surfaces spatial *trace events* through
  the profiler, and spatial clauses in the query console, but neither accessor is called anywhere in `tools/`.
- **Reads are lock-free and can tear across the fence.** A snapshot taken while the fence runs may mix values from
  either side of it. That is deliberate — serialising a diagnostic reader against the fence would cost more than the
  inconsistency is worth. Call it after the fence and before the next tick for a coherent view.
- **Per-tick members reset at the top of every fence; cumulative members restart with the cluster state.**
  `InitializeArchetypes` reallocates the per-archetype state, so a repeat call returns the totals to zero. They measure
  the life of the cluster state, not of the process.
- **`GetSpatialTelemetryTotal()` sums, except where summing would lie.** Every member is summed across archetypes except
  `MeasuredNsPerEntity`, which is averaged over the archetypes that produced an estimate — a cost *per entity* is
  intensive, and four archetypes are not four times as expensive per entity as each of them is.
- **`MigrationExecuteMs` and `MigrationTotalMs` are CPU-milliseconds, not span.** Eight workers each busy for one
  millisecond report eight, not one, and the sum can exceed the tick's elapsed time.
- **`RepairedEntityCount` is the planner's commitment, not the outcome.** A repair emits ordinary migration requests, so
  its entities are counted in `MigrationCount` too when those requests execute; the two differ by the requests whose
  source slot had emptied in between.
- **`RelocationsSuperseded` looks alarming and is not.** It counts relocations dropped because a cell crossing already
  claimed the same entity. An entity that drifted to the edge of its cell is exactly the one most likely to leave it, so
  the overlap is the common case on a moving world. Only worry when it starts tracking `RelocationsThrottled`.
