# Spatial Query Predicates
> R-Tree-backed AABB, radius, and ray filters attached directly to a fluent ECS query.

**Status:** ✅ Implemented · **Visibility:** Public · **Level:** 🟣 Advanced · **Category:** [Querying](./README.md)

## 🎯 What it solves

Game-server and simulation workloads constantly ask spatial questions — "what's in this room", "what's within aggro range", "what does this ray hit" — that a B+Tree field index cannot answer efficiently. Brute-force scanning every entity's position component to test bounds is O(n) per query and falls apart well before 10K entities at 60Hz. Spatial Query Predicates give `EcsQuery` three index-driven spatial filters (AABB overlap, radius/sphere, ray intersection) that run against a dedicated R-Tree instead of a linear scan, and compose with the rest of the query builder (archetype constraints, field predicates, opaque post-filters).

## ⚙️ How it works (in brief)

Mark the field that defines an entity's bounds with `[SpatialIndex]`; the engine maintains an R-Tree per component table, updated as entities spawn, move, and despawn. `WhereInAABB<T>`, `WhereNearby<T>`, and `WhereRay<T>` attach one spatial predicate to the query — the tree (not a table scan) produces the candidate set, which is then narrowed by archetype mask, any `.Where()`/`.WhereField()` predicate chained onto the same query (AND semantics), and visibility. Only one spatial predicate is allowed per query; static (rarely-moving) and dynamic entities are indexed in separate trees but queried transparently together.

## 💻 Usage

```csharp
[Component("Game.Position", 1)]
public struct Position
{
    [SpatialIndex]
    public float X, Y, Z;
}

using var t = dbe.CreateQuickTransaction();

// AABB overlap — entities whose Position bounds intersect the box
var inRoom = t.Query<UnitArch>()
    .WhereInAABB<Position>(minX: 0, minY: 0, minZ: 0, maxX: 50, maxY: 0, maxZ: 50)
    .Execute();                                          // → HashSet<EntityId>

// Radius — entities within range of a point
var nearby = t.Query<UnitArch>()
    .WhereNearby<Position>(centerX: 10, centerY: 0, centerZ: 10, radius: 15)
    .Without<Dead>()
    .Execute();

// Ray — first-hit-style candidate set along a direction
var hit = t.Query<UnitArch>()
    .WhereRay<Position>(originX: 0, originY: 1, originZ: 0, dirX: 1, dirY: 0, dirZ: 0, maxDist: 100)
    .Any();
```

| Constructor arg (`[SpatialIndex]`) | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `cellSize` | `0` (auto) | Bucket size for the static/bulk-loaded tree variant |
| `Mode` | `SpatialMode.Dynamic` | `Static` skips per-tick update maintenance for rarely-moving entities |
| `Category` | `uint.MaxValue` | Archetype-level bitmask; lets a per-cluster broadphase skip whole archetype clusters that don't overlap the query |

## ⚠️ Guarantees & limits

- **One spatial predicate per query** — a second `WhereNearby`/`WhereInAABB`/`WhereRay` call throws `InvalidOperationException`; run separate queries and combine in application code.
- **Composable with `Where`/`WhereField`** — both are applied as an AND post-filter over the spatial candidate set, not a second index probe.
- **Archetype-mask filtered** — results respect `.With<T>()`/`.Without<T>()`/`.Exclude<T>()` the same as any other query.
- **Not supported on `foreach`** — iterating the query directly only applies the archetype scan + `.Where()`; a spatial predicate throws. Call `.Execute()` (or `.Any()`/`.Count()`) instead.
- **Not supported with `WhereField` on `ToView()`** — a reactive view cannot combine an indexed field predicate with a spatial predicate; a spatial-only (or spatial + opaque `Where`) view falls back to full re-query (pull mode) on every `Refresh()`, not incremental delta tracking.
- **Not supported with `ExecuteOrdered`** — spatial predicates don't carry an ordering; use `Execute()` and sort in application code if needed.
- **Sub-microsecond at 10K entities**; ~600µs total spatial budget at 100K entities for a 60Hz tick (3.6% of frame).
- **kNN-style "nearest N" is not exposed** at this layer — only set-membership filters (AABB/radius/ray).
