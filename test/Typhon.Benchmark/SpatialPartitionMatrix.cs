// #872 — the spatial partitioning matrix.
//
// ONE workload, run across a cross product of world shape, motion model, density and population, with the same
// instrumentation taken every time. The point is not any single number: it is which axis each cost actually tracks.
// The design's own open questions are the ones this answers with measurements rather than estimates — Q2 (escape
// rate), Q4 (ns/entity for re-clustering), Q6 (the budget → tightness → selectivity curve) and Q7 (migration rate
// under real motion, and how much hysteresis absorbs).
//
// Everything reported is either a wall-clock measurement taken here or a counter the engine already publishes on
// SpatialMigrationTelemetry. Nothing is derived from a model.
//
// Run:  bin/Release/net10.0/Typhon.Benchmark.exe --profile-partition [--matrix A|B|C|D|all] [--ticks N] [--csv path]
