/// <b>Two numbers, reported separately on purpose.</b> The phase is a serial prep (merge the per-worker staging buffers, sort by key, snap the part
/// boundaries to leaf edges) followed by a parallel apply. <c>AC-6.5</c> asks for 0.7 x W to W = 8, and quoting that against the apply alone would be
/// flattering nonsense: what a tick pays is prep + apply, and Amdahl's law on the prep is precisely what decides whether the gate is reachable. Both
/// speedups are printed.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The sort is the part the design assumed away.</b> §5.5 says "the batch is already sorted by key (the partitioning descent requires it)". The batch
/// that migration produces is sorted by DESTINATION CELL, not by index key, so the conversion adds a sort nobody budgeted for. It is measured here as its
/// own column rather than folded into a phase total, because if it dominates then the honest answer is to say so and drop the conversion.
/// </para>

/// <b>Two shapes, and the clustered one is expected to lose.</b> §5.5 already says it: "10 000 updates over ~400 leaves is ~26 us single-threaded -
/// spreading that across 16 workers saves ~24 us and costs two barriers, which may be a wash." The uniform shape is where parallelism is supposed to pay,
