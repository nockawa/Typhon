/// queries take the SoA scan, which evaluates predicates against component data and never consults the tree — so the index could be arbitrarily wrong while
/// every assertion passed. Spawn and destroy had index-level assertions; update did not, and that empty cell was a real defect (#675).

/// <b>Index → data</b> catches an OVER-POPULATION and, more importantly, a MIS-POINTED leaf: a leaf that resolves to an unoccupied slot, or to a slot holding a
/// different entity. That second case is what a wrong-slot copy during a re-cluster produces, and no amount of "is the key present" checking finds it — the key
/// IS present, it just names the wrong entity. A one-direction oracle would pass.

/// <c>SchemaEvolutionTests.IndexedEntities</c> (strict, and the model this generalises), <c>Probe671IdxMigTests.IndexedEntities</c> (lenient — it accepted a
/// leaf naming an unoccupied slot), and <c>RecoveryOracle.ClusterIndexEntityIds</c>. Three implementations of one invariant means three chances to write the
/// lenient one, and the lenient one is the one that passes when the code is broken.

/// <para>
/// <b>Duplicate keys on a unique index are reported as a violation in their own right.</b> A unique index physically cannot represent two entities at one key,
