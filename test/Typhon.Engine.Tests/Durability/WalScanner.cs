/// This exists because of what <c>rules/durability.md</c> says about LOG-06: the rule was retired to
/// <c>verified: NOT COVERED</c> on 2026-08-07 (#703) precisely because both fixtures claiming it — <c>RecordCodecPropertyTests</c> and
/// <c>FenceBlockCodecTests</c> — build their own wire bytes and round-trip them. They exercise the codec's arithmetic and are
/// structurally incapable of observing the <b>emitter</b> putting a physical identifier on the wire, which is the only thing LOG-06
/// constrains. Both were green in the same build as a red production probe. A verifier for an emitter rule has to read what the
/// emitter wrote, so this scanner reads the real segments through the engine's own reader and codec.

/// FenceBlock records (#559) are expanded into the same per-(entity, slot) shape as <see cref="RecordKind.Slot"/>, mirroring
/// <c>RecoveryDriver</c>. That is deliberate: the columnar path copies component columns straight out of the cluster page, so it
/// carries a collection handle exactly as a per-entity Slot payload does, and a LOG-06 assertion that only looked at Slot records
/// would miss half the emitters.
