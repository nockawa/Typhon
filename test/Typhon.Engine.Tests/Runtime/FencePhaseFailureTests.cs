/// #890 — what the runtime does when a FENCE phase throws.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Before #890 the answer was "records it in per-system telemetry and keeps ticking". A phase whose <c>Prepare</c> threw was marked
/// <see cref="SkipReason.Exception"/>, every successor phase was skipped as <see cref="SkipReason.DependencyFailed"/>, and nothing reached the host:
/// <c>UnhandledExceptionCallback</c> was invoked only from the WorkerLoop's outer safety net, which a <c>Prepare</c> failure never passes through. That is
/// how #889's <c>NullReferenceException</c> ran for a whole session with no WAL emit, no dormancy sweep and no dirty-ring archive on every tick with dirty
/// data — TP-01a's failure mode exactly, and silent at the point of damage.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The injection point is <see cref="ArchetypeClusterState.PrepQueueProbe"/>, which the fence calls at the end of <c>FinishArchetypeFencePrep</c>. No
/// production seam exists for this and none should: the probe is already there, and throwing from it reproduces #889's shape without simulating it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// 🔴 <b>Which GATE it lands on depends on whether Prep sliced, and both are covered because they are different catch sites.</b> An archetype below
/// <see cref="DatabaseEngine.PrepSliceMinClusters"/> runs the atomic <c>ArchetypePrep</c> work item, so the probe throws from <c>DispatchItem</c> — an
/// <b>Execute</b> chunk. A sliced one reaches the same call from Prep's serial tail inside <c>FenceMigrateExecSystem.Prepare</c> — a <b>Prepare</b> gate,
/// which is the one #889 actually hit and the one that reached the host through nothing at all. A fixture that only covered the Execute path would be
/// asserting the case that was already half-working.
