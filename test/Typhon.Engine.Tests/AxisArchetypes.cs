// The component kit. Nine structs: three storage modes × three index kinds.
//
// Every struct in a mode has the SAME field set in the SAME order, differing ONLY in which field carries an [Index] attribute. That is deliberate: a fixture
// asserting "the value round-trips" must assert the identical thing in all three, so a difference in outcome is attributable to the index kind and to nothing
// else. Differing layouts would confound the axis with the payload.
//
//   Key     — distinctive per entity (i*7+1). The identity the assertions check, and the UNIQUE index key.
//   Bucket  — deliberately duplicated (i % 4). The AllowMultiple index key; a multi-index over distinct values would never exercise the duplicate path.
//   Weight  — float, distinctive (i*1.5f). Catches a field-offset error that an int-only payload would read as plausible.
//   Tag     — long, distinctive (i*1000+3). Catches a truncation or a 4-vs-8 byte stride mistake.
