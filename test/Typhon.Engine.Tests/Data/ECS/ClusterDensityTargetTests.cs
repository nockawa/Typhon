/// Step 14 of the VDB cell-grid design (§5.8, decisions D1 and D2): the intra-cell target is a function of the cell's population, repair is charged
/// before relocation, the budget is spent on the target rather than on a queue prefix, and the cost model charges span rather than summed CPU.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>What was measured, and what these tests hold.</b> With a constant target of 0.25 × cell the drift gate fired on every written cluster on
/// every tick in every configuration the density guidance recommends, because a full cluster in a cell of E entities cannot be tighter than
/// <c>(64 / E)^(1/d)</c> — 1.0 in the 16–64 basin. Relocations then consumed the whole budget on every tick (<c>relocationSpendMs == budget</c> up to
/// 16 ms), the planner entered with a median 630 ns of 8 ms, and 91–99 % of admitted relocations rejected their pin because every drifter of a cell
/// named the same empty cluster. Each test below pins one of those against its fix.</para>
/// <para>The engine fixtures use the serial <c>WriteTickFence</c>, which is the path whose parallelism is 1 — the span-based estimator is therefore
