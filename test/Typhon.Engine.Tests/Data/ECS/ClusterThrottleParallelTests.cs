/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>Why this needs a real runtime, and why a <c>WriteTickFence</c> loop would prove nothing.</b>
/// <c>ClusterMigrationTests</c> records the measurement: ablating the parallel fence's plan emission left <b>5 692 tests green</b>, because almost every
/// migration fixture drives the SERIAL fence. Anything asserted about parallel behaviour from a serial driver is asserted about code that did not run.</para>
/// <para><b>What makes determinism true here, rather than merely observed.</b> The throttle is a single-threaded, order-preserving partition at the tail of
/// Prep, and the repair queue is ranked on the same thread. Nothing about either decision is reached by more than one worker, so worker count cannot enter
/// it.</para>
/// <para><b>What is asserted is the RULE at every W, not an identical packing — and the difference is not a weakening.</b> Cross-arm packing equality
/// is what <c>ClusterRepairParallelTests</c> checks, and it can only check it because a repair PINS its destination slot. A step-10 relocation deliberately
/// does not: it names a destination cluster and lets <c>ClaimSlotInCell</c> pick the slot. The parallel path then runs
/// <c>SortPendingMigrationsByDestCellKey</c> — an <b>unstable</b> sort on a comparer that reads only the cell key — and the worker-local drifter buffers are
/// merged in completion order, so which entity wins a contested slot legitimately varies with W. <c>MigrationRequest.DestSlotIndex</c> documents exactly this,
/// and it is why the repair path pins and the relocation path does not.</para>
/// <para>So a fixture demanding identical packings across W would be asserting something the design explicitly declines to promise, and the first version of
/// this one did — reporting a throttle bug for behaviour that belongs to the sort. What <c>AC-11.6</c> is actually about is whether the ADMISSION DECISION
/// depends on scheduling, and that is checkable exactly: at every W, no tick may admit more than the budget pays for, and every detected drifter must be
/// accounted for as admitted, throttled or unplaced. A throttle that consulted anything worker-dependent would break one of those at W = 8 and not at
/// W = 1.</para>
