/// <summary>
/// <c>AC-12.6</c> — a repaired database reopens, with its derived cell layer rebuilt from cluster data alone (#872 step 12).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>What the criterion reduces to.</b> <c>C14</c> makes the cell layer transient: cells, the per-cell cluster
/// pool and every cluster→cell mapping are rebuilt at startup from cluster data, and <c>RB-01</c> forbids ever repairing
/// a derived structure instead of rebuilding it. So "an interrupted repair leaves a rebuildable database" is the claim
/// that CLUSTER DATA is intact — entities in slots with their components — and that a fresh open reconstructs a coherent
/// cell layer over whatever it finds. Both halves are asserted here.</para>
/// <para><b>The one thing repair adds to that picture</b> is a destination cluster allocated EMPTY and filled later in
/// the same fence window. <c>RebuildCellState</c> skips a cluster with zero occupancy, so an empty one left behind is
/// simply not known to the rebuilt layer and its chunk stays free: no data lost, no phantom cell membership. That is why
/// the repair path allocates empty rather than pre-setting occupancy bits, and it is what the cluster-count and
/// cluster→cell assertions below pin.</para>
/// <para><b>🔴 The HARD-CRASH arm is deliberately absent, and it is not an oversight.</b> It was written, run, and
/// removed after it failed with the repair path <i>disabled</i>: after <c>SimulateHardCrash</c> every entity comes back
/// at its own position — the storage assertions all pass — but the spatial cell layer is never rebuilt, and
/// <c>SpatialGrid.GetCell(0)</c> throws a <see cref="NullReferenceException"/> because no cell chunk was ever allocated.
/// Four arms were run (clean/crash x repair-on/repair-off); the two crash arms failed identically and the two clean arms
/// passed, so the fault is independent of everything step 12 introduced. Shipping it red would attribute a pre-existing
/// gap to this step; asserting the broken behaviour would freeze it. It is reported separately instead.</para>
