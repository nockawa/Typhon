/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>The defect this fixture exists for was worth three symptoms and no diagnosis.</b> A sustained-motion workload lost entities on a few percent of
/// seeds, and surfaced as <c>InvalidOperationException: Entity(...) not found or not visible</c>, as
/// <c>B+Tree bulk update reached an invalid child</c>, and once as an <c>AccessViolationException</c> — three failures far enough apart to look like three
/// bugs. All three were one cause: two queued migrations naming the same <c>(cluster, slot)</c>.</para>
/// <para><b>Why the engine does not catch it on its own.</b> <c>ExecuteMigrations</c> has a stale-source guard, and it looks like it should cover exactly
/// this — but it tests OCCUPANCY, not identity. It therefore saves the case where the slot is still empty when the second request drains, and misses the
/// case where an unrelated migrant has claimed it, which the repair path makes likely because it allocates fresh destinations and frees drained sources
/// inside one fence. The second request then moves the WRONG entity to a destination reserved for someone else.</para>
/// <para><b>Two producers, two exclusions, asserted separately.</b> The throttle drops a relocation a mandatory request supersedes; the repair planner
/// refuses to gather a slot already claimed. Neither subsumes the other — the first is cross-tick (drift is detected in AabbRefresh and decided by the next
/// Prep), the second is same-tick (the crossing detector and the planner both run in Prep).</para>
