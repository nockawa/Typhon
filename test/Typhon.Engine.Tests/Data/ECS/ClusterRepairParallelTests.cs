/// <summary>
/// <c>AC-12.4</c> — a repair produces the identical packing under the serial fence and under the parallel fence at
/// <c>W ∈ {1, 2, 8}</c> (#872 step 12).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>What could make it differ, and why it does not.</b> The repair has one parallel stage and two serial ones.
/// NOMINATION runs on AabbRefresh workers, so which worker appends a given cell key, and in what order, is scheduling —
/// but the output is consumed as a SET: the planner sorts the nominations and skips repeats, so any permutation of the
/// same cells yields the same iteration. PLANNING runs in Prep, one work item per archetype, so the ranking, the Morton
/// sort and the destination assignment are single-threaded by contract. EXECUTION is sliced across workers, and it is
/// the reason <c>MigrationRequest</c> gained a pinned SLOT in this step: with only the cluster pinned, two workers
/// claiming into one fresh cluster would fill it first-fit in whatever order they arrived, and the sorted packing would
/// survive only when a slice boundary happened not to fall inside a cell's run.</para>
/// <para><b>Compared as the packing, not as chunk ids.</b> Which chunk id a destination gets depends on the segment's
/// free list, which depends on the whole allocation history of the run. The result that matters — and the one the design
/// means by "identical" — is which entities share a cluster and in what slot order, so the canonical form here is the
/// per-cluster tag sequence, with clusters ordered by their own first tag. Two runs that agree on that agree on every
/// bound, every zone map and every query answer.</para>
/// <para><b>Driven by a real <see cref="TyphonRuntime"/> for the parallel arms.</b> <c>ClusterMigrationTests</c> records
/// what happens otherwise: ablating the parallel EntityMap phase left 5 692 tests green, because nearly every fixture
/// drives <c>WriteTickFence</c> — the serial drain — under the name of the parallel one.</para>
