/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>Why this runs before the tree is wired in, not after.</b> Wiring <see cref="CellClusterTree"/> into production is a 47-site change across seven
/// files, and nothing yet shows the tree wins at the cluster counts this engine actually runs. <see cref="CellSpatialIndex"/>'s own class doc puts AntHill's
/// dense zones at <b>&#8804;80 clusters per cell</b>, while §4.1's 2-9x prediction is at <b>C = 1563</b>. If the crossover sits between those two numbers, the
/// honest answer is a hybrid keyed on cluster count, not a wholesale replacement — and that is a conclusion best reached before the churn, not after.</para>
/// <para><b>Both sides of the ledger, because they move in opposite directions.</b> The tree prunes, so queries get cheaper as C grows. But maintenance gets
/// DEARER: the linear index's <c>UpdateAt</c> is six float stores into SoA, while the tree must unpack a handle, resolve a chunk address, check leaf-ness and
/// payload identity, test containment on six axes, take a latch — and on the changes that escape their leaf, remove and reinsert instead. A query-only
/// benchmark would therefore report a win that a real tick does not see. The crossover is a surface over (C, selectivity, query:update ratio), and this
/// fixture measures the first two directly so the third is arithmetic.</para>
/// <para><b>Cluster size scales with 1/sqrt(C) on purpose.</b> A cluster holds a roughly fixed number of entities, so a cell with more clusters has SMALLER
/// ones — the clusters tile the cell rather than growing to fill it. Holding cluster extent constant while raising C would instead model every cluster
/// overlapping every query, which is the one regime where a tree cannot prune, and would rig the result against it.</para>
/// <para><b><see cref="ExplicitAttribute"/> — this is an instrument, not a gate.</b> It reports numbers and asserts only that the two structures agree on what
/// they found; a timing threshold in the suite would be a machine-specific guess that reddens on a busy box. Run it deliberately:</para>

// Manual rather than Nightly, deliberately. What this fixture produces is wall-clock timings whose whole purpose is to be COMPARED, and a shared CI runner
// contends for cache and cores in ways that move them by more than the effects being measured — a nightly series of numbers nobody can trust is worse than no
// series, because it invites conclusions. It also takes ~2 minutes, and its only assertions are that the two structures agree, which the differential fixture
// already gates on every run. Re-run it when the decision it informs is revisited: a change to the tree's fan-out, split heuristic, or update path.
