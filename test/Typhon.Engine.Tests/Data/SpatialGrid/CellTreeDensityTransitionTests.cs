/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>What was missing, and why it was not a small gap.</b> Both structures were implemented and separately tested, and the threshold that chooses
/// between them shipped defaulted to <see cref="int.MaxValue"/> with no writer anywhere in the engine — so no database ever promoted a cell, and the R-Tree
/// was code that could not be reached from a supported configuration. Raising the threshold was not enough either: a startup guard refused promotion
/// together with the parallel fence, which is the default runtime, and it was right to. The fix is upstream of both — the shared per-archetype arrays a
/// Migrate worker indexes through no longer reallocate under its siblings — so this fixture asserts the OUTCOME rather than the plumbing: a cell that fills
/// up ends on a tree, a cell that empties out ends on a scan, and neither transition changes the answer to a query.</para>
/// <para><b>Transitions are observed as they happen, not inferred at the end.</b> A final-state assertion passes just as well against an engine that promoted
/// once at spawn and never re-evaluated, which is close to the behaviour being fixed. <see cref="ShapePerTick"/> records the discriminator on every tick, so
/// the assertions can say WHERE the switch happened and that nothing switched before it should have.</para>
/// <para><b>Which test covers what, by ablation.</b> Reverting the pre-size to where it used to sit reddens
/// <see cref="PromotionSurvivesTheParallelFence_WhileClustersMigrateBetweenCells"/> by name — the growth refusal fires from a Migrate slice, which is how the
/// mis-placed pre-size was found. But reverting the REFUSAL as well leaves that test green, because with the growers serialised on the latch two of them can
/// no longer drop each other's copy, and what remains is a sibling holding a stale reference — an interleaving no test can force on demand. So that test
/// proves the configuration runs, not that the guard works.
/// <see cref="AShortPerArchetypeArrayAbortsTheTickInsteadOfGrowingUnderSiblingWorkers"/> is the one that proves the guard: it falsifies the bound directly
/// and is red with the guard removed, green with it present.</para>
/// <para><b>Cluster counts, not entity counts.</b> A cluster holds up to 64 entities of one archetype in one cell, so the thresholds here are two orders of
/// magnitude below the shipped default — a fixture that used the production number would spend its time spawning a quarter of a million entities to prove
/// something the small number proves exactly as well.</para>
