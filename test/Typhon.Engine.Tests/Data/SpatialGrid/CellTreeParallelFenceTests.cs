/// <summary>
/// <c>AC-4</c> — the per-cell R-Tree under a REAL parallel fence: 50 ticks of motion, four workers, on both AabbRefresh slicing branches.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>What is under test is a divert, not a lock.</b> <see cref="SpatialRTree{TStore}"/> is single-writer by specification (ADR-044, invariant
/// <c>O2</c>), and the AabbRefresh phase slices by CLUSTER id rather than by cell — so two workers routinely carry clusters of the SAME cell and would be two
/// writers in one tree. <c>ApplyOrDeferClusterUpdate</c> answers that by buffering every promoted cell's write worker-side and replaying it on one thread in
/// the fence tail (<c>DrainPromotedAabbApplies</c>). This fixture is the evidence that the answer holds under the interleaving it was written for.</para>
/// <para><b>Both branches, because the defect lived in exactly one of them.</b> The <c>ClusterProcessBitmap</c> branch was diverted first and the
/// <c>ActiveClusterIds</c> branch was not, and the test that was supposed to cover it happened to exercise the undiverted one. Which branch runs is decided by
/// <c>SetSpatialBarrierOnly</c>, so the identical scenario runs under both.</para>
/// <para><b>The shipped cost model, and the partition is checked rather than assumed.</b> An earlier version of this fixture seeded the planner at
/// 500 µs/cluster on the stated grounds that the default 2.4 µs "collapses this population to a single chunk". That was wrong twice over: the formula quoted
/// was <c>ComputeMaxChunks</c>, which the AabbRefresh emitter never calls, and the real one — <c>FenceWorkPlan.ComputeChunkCountAndPack</c>,
/// <c>ceil(totalCost / max(200µs, maxAtomicCost))</c>, whose own comment says worker count is irrelevant — gives <b>2 chunks</b> at the default for the 148
/// dirty clusters this population produces. Measured, not argued. The override is gone; <c>AdaptiveFenceCost</c> stays off only so the plan
/// <see cref="AssertPlanStraddlesAPromotedCell"/> rebuilds is the one the run actually used. That assertion is what makes the interleaving a fact: it proves
/// some promoted cell's clusters landed in two DIFFERENT chunks, which is "two workers, one tree" for an undiverted implementation.</para>
/// <para><b>Migrations are deliberately absent HERE.</b> Motion is a rotation about each cluster's own cell centre, at a radius inside the cell's inscribed
/// circle, so no entity ever leaves its cell. That keeps this fixture about the AabbRefresh divert and nothing else. The Migrate half — a worker inserting
/// into a cell's index while siblings hold the archetype-wide arrays it indexes through — is <c>CellTreeDensityTransitionTests</c>.</para>
/// <para><b>Non-vacuity, by ablation.</b> Reverting the divert alone — <c>ApplyOrDeferClusterUpdate</c> calling <c>UpdateClusterInPerCellIndex</c>
/// unconditionally, every other line untouched — turns both tests red in three runs of three, on <see cref="AssertPromotedTreesAgreeWithClusterState"/>:
/// <i>"cell 1 holds cluster 46 twice"</i>. A duplicated leaf entry is precisely what two concurrent remove-and-reinserts leave behind. The
/// <c>maxPromotedApplies</c> guard also reddens under that ablation and proves NOTHING — with the divert gone nothing is ever deferred, so a zero there is a
/// tautology. The ablation was judged with that guard suppressed, which is the only way it says anything about corruption.</para>
/// <para><b>Membership AND freshness.</b> Both halves are asserted, but they fail differently and both are needed. A second writer in one tree corrupts
/// MEMBERSHIP — a duplicated or lost leaf entry. A deferral that is buffered and never replayed corrupts FRESHNESS — the tree keeps a bound the entities have
/// rotated out of, while membership stays perfect. <see cref="AssertQueriesMatchStorageTruth"/> covers the second by comparing query answers against entity
/// positions read straight out of the cluster segment, which shares no code with the index it checks.</para>
