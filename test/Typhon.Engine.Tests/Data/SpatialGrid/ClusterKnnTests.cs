/// <para>The design singles kNN out as the one operation that must be REIMPLEMENTED rather than ported, because a cluster's distance is a lower bound rather
/// than a distance. The implementation is best-first over clusters with early termination, so the two things worth testing are that it returns the right
/// answer and that it does so without opening everything.</para>
/// <para><b>The oracle is a full scan, and it has to be.</b> Comparing kNN against another pruning implementation would share the pruning assumption, and a
/// wrong bound would agree with itself. Every entity is measured directly.</para>
