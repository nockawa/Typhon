/// Key extraction for <see cref="RadixSort"/>: the unsigned 64-bit key whose ascending order is the order wanted. Implemented by a stateless struct per
/// call site, so the JIT specialises the sort on it and the key read inlines — no delegate, no interface dispatch, which is the whole reason the sort
/// beats <c>Array.Sort</c> through an <c>IComparer</c>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The key is UNSIGNED. A site whose natural key is signed flips its sign bit through <see cref="RadixSort.SignedKey(int)"/> or
/// <see cref="RadixSort.SignedKey(long)"/>; a floating-point site goes through <c>ZoneMapArray.FloatToOrderedLong</c> first. Nothing in the sort
/// interprets the key beyond its bits.

/// <summary>
/// Stable LSD radix sort over 11-bit digits, for the fence's hot-path sorts of small structs by an integer field (#889, generalised).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>Why not <c>Array.Sort</c>.</b> Introsort is <c>n log n</c> comparisons, each through the comparer and each moving the whole element; on the
/// migration queue it measured 150–175 ns a request for ~5 000 20-byte requests through an <c>IComparer</c>, 931 µs a tick on the fence's serial path.
/// The keys at every site this serves are cell ids, bucket indices, cluster ids or index keys of which a live world uses a narrow range, so a radix sort
/// is <c>O(n)</c> with a small constant: at most <c>ceil(bits / digit)</c> passes, and a digit that is the same for every key costs no pass at all —
/// low, high or in the middle — so a 32-bit key that spans a few thousand values costs one or two passes rather than three. The same queue measured
/// 63 µs.</para>
/// <para><b>Stable.</b> The scatter writes equal digits in input order, so items sharing a key keep the order they arrived in — a property
/// <c>Array.Sort</c> does not have and that <c>RP-02</c> now relies on. A site that needs a total order over TWO fields sorts by the minor key first and
/// the major key second, both stable, and gets exactly the lexicographic order.</para>
/// <para><b>Caller-owned scratch, no allocation here.</b> <c>scratch</c> is the ping-pong partner and must hold at least <c>items.Length</c> elements;
/// <c>counts</c> is the histogram and must hold <see cref="Buckets"/> ints. Every site has a natural owner for both — the cluster state, the staging
/// buffer, the exec system's per-chunk arrays — and pooling them here would put a lock or a thread-static on a path that is otherwise free of both. The
/// result is always left in <c>items</c>; an odd number of passes ends in the scratch and is copied back.</para>
/// <para><b>Which digits get a pass.</b> One pass over the keys ORs them and ANDs them; <c>or ^ and</c> is exactly the set of bits that vary across the
/// run — a bit is set in it iff some key has it set and some key has it clear. A digit with no varying bit is skipped before its histogram, wherever it
/// sits. 🔴 The first version derived this from <c>min ^ max</c>, which is NOT exact: the two extremes can agree on their low bits while a key between
/// them differs there (<c>{0, 0x100, 0x101, 0x200}</c> — review caught it, <c>RadixSortTests</c> pins it). Only the extremes' shared HIGH bits are
/// shared by every key between them; their shared low bits prove nothing.</para>
/// <para><b>Adaptive digit width.</b> Every pass pays a fixed cost proportional to the bucket count — the histogram clear and, above all, the prefix sum
/// over every bucket — and a per-item cost proportional to the count. At 2 048 buckets the fixed part is ~1.3 µs a pass, which is more than a 128-item
/// run's whole introsort; at 256 buckets it is ~0.15 µs. So a run below <see cref="WideDigitMinCount"/> items takes 8-bit digits (up to eight passes,
/// cheap ones) and a larger run takes 11-bit digits (up to six). Measured in <c>RadixSortBenchmarks</c>, before and after, per shape and size.</para>
