/// <para><b>What it replaces.</b> Step 12 kept nominations in a <c>List&lt;int&gt;</c> that the planner drained and cleared every tick, and ordered them
/// with <c>Array.Sort</c> on the cell KEY. Two consequences, both stated in that code's own remarks as step 11's to fix: a cell whose unit the budget could
/// not afford was <b>forgotten</b> rather than deferred, and the order in which cells were tried was arbitrary with respect to how much repairing any of
/// them would buy. This structure fixes the first by outliving the tick and the second by ranking.</para>
/// <para><b>Round-robin is explicitly the wrong policy</b> (§5.6): "a region nobody queries never needs tight clusters". So candidates are ranked by
/// expected selectivity gain — <c>degradation x tierWeight x clusterCount</c> — and aged so that ranking cannot starve anyone (<c>AC-11.3</c>).</para>
/// <para><b>Per archetype, never shared.</b> The scores read <c>CellClusterPool</c>, which is per-archetype, and the units it schedules are that
/// archetype's clusters. Two archetypes over one cell are two independent candidates, which is correct: they degrade and are repaired independently.</para>
/// <para><b>Transient, and owes the WAL nothing.</b> Every field here is derived from cluster bounds that are themselves rebuilt at startup. A crash loses
/// the queue and the next tick's AABB pass re-nominates whatever still deserves it.</para>
/// <para><b>Single-threaded by contract.</b> Every method is called from Prep, which runs one work item per archetype. Nomination — the parallel half —
/// goes into <c>ArchetypeClusterState.RepairNominations</c> under the finalize lock and is folded in here by <see cref="Absorb"/>.</para>
