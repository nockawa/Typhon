/// The repair path — a full Morton re-sort and re-pack of a degraded cell (#872 step 12, design §5.2 and §5.6).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>Two mechanisms, not one.</b> Step 10's detect-and-relocate is a per-tick <i>delta</i>: it moves the entities that drifted and leaves the rest
/// alone, which is affordable every tick and converges only while the layout is nearly right. This is the <i>repair</i>: it discards the existing layout of
/// a unit entirely, sorts its entities by position and re-packs them in sort order. Optimal tightness for a given cluster size, ~6 ms for a 100 K-entity
/// cell, and therefore rare by construction.</para>
/// <para><b>Why the delta path cannot do this.</b> Relocation is greedy and local — each drifter goes to whichever existing cluster grows least. A cell whose
/// clusters are ALL wrong has no good destination to offer, so the greedy step shuffles entities between bad boxes. Measured on this branch at step 10: a
/// randomly-laid-out cell produced ~26 relocations per entity over 30 ticks and the mean extent still rose. The re-sort is what recovers such a cell, and it
/// is the only thing in the engine that <b>shrinks a zone map</b> — <c>ZoneMapArray.Widen</c> is the sole other writer and it never narrows.</para>
/// <para><b>Where it runs, and why there.</b> Nomination happens in AabbRefresh, off the same <c>cellSize x 1.2</c> extent check the outlier guard already
/// computes (design parameter P7) — the extents are in registers, so nominating costs one list append on a cluster that has already failed a threshold.
/// Planning happens in <b>Prep</b> of the following tick, which is single-threaded per archetype, and the requests it emits are executed by that same tick's
/// Migrate phase. Everything the plan allocates is therefore created and consumed inside one exclusive fence window, so nothing OUTSIDE the fence — no
/// user-system spawn — can claim into a destination the sort reserved, and the plan is produced by exactly one thread, which is what makes <c>AC-12.4</c>
/// true by construction rather than by scheduling luck. Inside the window a same-tick migration that overflows its own pinned cluster can still first-fit
/// into one of these; that costs the repair a slot and is handled by the fallback chain, not by exclusivity.</para>
/// <para><b>Deviation from §5.2, stated deliberately.</b> The design's cost table gives the repair path "claim / release slot: <b>none</b>", on the grounds
/// that a re-pack knows its destinations and need not claim them. This implementation instead emits ordinary <see cref="MigrationRequest"/>s carrying a
/// pinned cluster AND a pinned slot, and lets <c>ExecuteMigrations</c> move them. The claim it pays is one uncontended CAS on a cache line the copy is about
/// to touch anyway. What it buys is that the ~400 lines maintaining <c>EntityMap</c> keying, the C15 cell-relative rebase, the H1 visibility fold, index
/// element ids, zone maps, dirty-bit deltas and orphan rollback are not duplicated for a path that runs rarely — so <c>AC-12.3</c> holds because the moves go
/// through the pipeline whose invariants are already tested, rather than because a second copy was got right. <c>AC-12.7</c>'s measurement is what
/// adjudicates whether the CAS ever mattered.</para>

        // critical cell can sit anywhere in the order and be reached only after the budget has been spent on cells that
        // merely scored well. Hoisting it is what makes the valve a queue-jump rather than a late consolation.
        //
        // 🔴 The scan then BREAKS rather than continuing, and over a persistent queue that is a different cost class from
        // the per-tick list step 12 had. `continue` meant every remaining candidate — up to RepairQueueMaxCells, 4 096 by
        // default — still paid GetClusters, the ranking loop, an Array.Sort and a geometry hash before failing the budget
        // test, single-threaded on Prep and charged to no budget at all. One unit exhausting a 1 ms budget left 4 095
        // cells fully planned for nothing.
        //
        // The break is safe because the ranking is monotone in what it can afford: candidates are ordered best-first and
        // the cheapest possible unit is two clusters, so once the remaining budget cannot cover that, nothing later in the
        // order can be admitted either — and the one admission that IS allowed to exceed the budget has already been tried.
        //
        // 🔴 "At most one overshoot per archetype per tick" is enforced STRUCTURALLY here, by the fact that exactly one call
        // site below passes `valveAvailable: true`. It used to be a `_valveFiredThisTick` flag, which this hoist orphaned —
        // the flag stayed assigned and reset for a while with no reader left, which is worse than no flag at all: it reads
        // as the thing enforcing the bound while enforcing nothing. One call site is provable by inspection.
        //
        // What that narrows, stated because it is a real behaviour change: if a SECOND cell is also critical, it is offered
        // no valve this tick and is refused like any other candidate. It ages, keeps its place in the queue and is the
        // hoisted one on a later tick, so AC-11.2's "serviced within N ticks" still holds — with a larger N when several
