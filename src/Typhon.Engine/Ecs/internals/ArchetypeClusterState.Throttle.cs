/// and the fence executed all of them; the repair planner had a budget but compared it against a hand-set constant and forgot whatever it refused.
/// §5.6's decision is that "re-clustering runs to a budget, never to completion", because deferring a pass costs one tick of looser bounds while
/// overrunning the frame costs the frame.</para>
/// <para><b>The two mechanisms budget differently, and §5.6 says why.</b> Delta relocation is resumable — each drifter is independent, so the budget can
/// stop anywhere — and is budgeted in ENTITIES. A repair cannot be halved: a partly re-sorted cell has paid the cost and banked part of the benefit, so
/// it is budgeted in WHOLE UNITS and a unit the remaining budget cannot finish is never begun.</para>
