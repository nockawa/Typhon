/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>One <see cref="SpatialRTree{TStore}"/> instance per cell, over a segment shared by every cell of one archetype.</b> The design proposed detaching
/// the tree's metadata from chunk 0 and threading a <c>ref</c> root through twelve methods so a single instance could serve every cell. That was measured and
/// found unnecessary: <c>SharedSegmentRTreeHarnessTests.Claim2</c> drives two ordinary trees over one segment through 120 interleaved inserts, splits both,
/// and each returns exactly its own payloads. The four metadata values are already per-INSTANCE fields; chunk 0 is a write-through mirror nothing reads
/// unless the tree is constructed with <c>load: true</c>, which a transient tree never is.</para>
/// <para><b>That measurement is SEQUENTIAL, and the concurrent case rests on something else.</b> <c>Claim2</c> interleaves the two trees' operations on one
/// thread — it spawns nothing — so it licenses two trees sharing a segment, not two trees mutating it at once. Cell-disjoint Migrate slices do produce the
/// latter: two workers can promote or grow two different cells simultaneously. What makes that safe is <see cref="ChunkBasedSegment{TStore}"/>'s own
/// allocator, which is lock-free with growth serialised on its <c>_growLock</c>, plus the double-check in <c>TryEnsureCellTreeSegment</c> for the creation
/// race. <c>CellTreeDensityTransitionTests</c> is the first thing that drives it from several workers at all.</para>
/// <para><b>The shared chunk 0 was the remaining worry, and it does not apply here.</b> The concern was that every tree on the segment writes chunk 0 on
/// every insert under the tree's own <c>_metadataLock</c>, one contended line per archetype once the fence runs cells in parallel. This type constructs its
/// tree with <c>mirrorMetadata: false</c> (see the constructor below), and <c>SpatialRTree.SyncMetadata</c> returns before taking that lock when the flag is
/// clear — so a cell cluster tree neither writes chunk 0 nor contends for it. The mirror exists for trees that may be reloaded with <c>load: true</c>, which
/// a transient per-cell tree never is.</para>
/// <para><b>Why one segment per cell was rejected, with the number.</b> A <see cref="ChunkBasedSegment{TStore}"/> spans at least two pages since the v4
/// directory-only root (the root page carries the page directory and holds zero chunks), so 16 KiB minimum. At the 128³ / 1 % baseline — 20 971 occupied
/// cells — that is ~328 MiB of mostly-empty segment per spatial archetype, against ~10 MiB for the whole VDB layer.</para>
/// <para><b>Payloads are cluster chunk ids and bounds are <c>C15</c> cell-relative.</b> Both follow from the structure being per-cell per-archetype: a cluster
