/// Per-archetype per-cell spatial slot holding one cluster index for each of the static/dynamic splits. Lazily allocated — an entry in

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Both dynamic and static halves are populated independently. An archetype's <see cref="SpatialFieldInfo.Mode"/> determines which one gets written at spawn
/// time (Dynamic → dynamic half, Static → static half), but a single cell may contain clusters of different archetypes with different modes, so both are
/// available. Queries check both and union results — this mirrors the pattern used by <c>SpatialIndexState.StaticTree</c> + <c>DynamicTree</c> at the
/// non-cluster level.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Issue #230 Phase 3 activated <see cref="StaticIndex"/> as part of closing the issue-body acceptance criterion 7 ("Static/dynamic split: static clusters
/// skip fence updates, queries check both"). Static archetype entities never move, so the tick-fence recompute pass skips static entries entirely — the index
/// is written on spawn, updated on destroy, and otherwise read-only.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Each half is EITHER a linear index OR a tree, never both (#872 step 9).</b> Above a per-cell cluster-count threshold the linear index is replaced by a
/// <see cref="CellClusterTree"/> and the <see cref="CellSpatialIndex"/> reference is dropped; below it, the reverse. Keeping both live would mean paying the
/// tree's maintenance cost AND the scan's on every update, which is the worst of both — and the whole reason the threshold exists is that the two structures
/// win in different regimes. <see cref="HasDynamicTree"/> / <see cref="HasStaticTree"/> is the discriminator every reader must consult; a reader that assumes
/// the linear index is present will see an empty cell rather than a wrong one, which is <c>SQ-01</c>'s silent direction, so the discriminator is not optional.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why a threshold rather than the wholesale replacement the design specified.</b> Measured, not assumed: below ~512 clusters in a cell the linear scan
/// beats the tree on selective queries — by 6x at 80 clusters, which is what AntHill's densest zones actually hold — and the tree's update path is 22-38x
/// dearer per moved cluster. Above ~1500 the tree wins by 3.6x and by 25.8x at 15625. Neither structure is right for both ends, and a real world contains
/// both: the clumped sweep puts the mean at 1.8 clusters per cell and the worst cell at 102 for the same population.
