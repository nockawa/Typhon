/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>Why sparse.</b> The dense predecessor allocated a <see cref="CellState"/> for every cell the world bounds implied, occupied or not — 128 MiB at a
/// 128³ grid, plus 24 B per cell <em>per spatial archetype</em> in the per-cell pools. A universe specified as 80 % empty paid all of it. Here an empty
/// region costs one absent hash entry.</para>
/// <para><b>Cost accepted</b> (§3.2): resolving a cell goes from one array index to a hash probe plus two dependent loads. A spatially coherent sweep pays
/// the probe once per BLOCK rather than once per cell — see the per-thread last-block fields.</para>
/// <para><b>A cell key is a pool slot, not a coordinate.</b> It names an occupied cell and nothing else, it is not stable across a rebuild, and it carries no
/// position — which is why <see cref="CellState"/> stores its own coordinates and <see cref="CellKeyToCoords"/> reads them back.</para>
/// <para><b>Creation is lazy and concurrent; destruction does not exist yet.</b> §3.5 places both inside the exclusive tick-fence window on the grounds that
/// both mutate shared structure. That is true of destruction — freeing a block under a live reader is a use-after-free — and false of creation, which is
/// monotonic: a concurrent reader either sees the cell or sees it absent, and "absent" was the correct answer a moment earlier. Windowing creation would
/// break read-your-writes, because <c>Transaction.CommitSpawns</c> resolves a cell inside the spawning transaction. Cell destruction is deferred, together
/// with the windowed sweep §3.5 describes; nothing in step 8 removes a cell.</para>
/// <para>The grid stores only transient state. Nothing in <see cref="CellState"/> is persisted; <c>RebuildCellState</c> reconstructs everything from entity
/// positions after a reopen.</para>
/// <para><b>Cells are three-dimensional.</b> A flat world is a grid one cell deep — see <see cref="SpatialGridConfig.Flat"/> — and its blocks are one cell
/// deep too, so a 2D game pays 256 index slots per block rather than 4 096.</para>
