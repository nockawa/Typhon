/// <para><b>These are measurement switches, not configuration.</b> They default to the optimised behaviour; the
/// benchmark flips them off to reproduce the pre-change path. Once the numbers are recorded each one either becomes
/// unconditional or is deleted — neither outcome wants a public knob, which is why this is an internal static rather
/// than a field on <c>SpatialOptions</c>. Same shape, and the same reasoning, as
/// <c>ArchetypeClusterState.PluralityStableRepack</c> in step 17's repair campaign.</para>
/// <para>Plain statics, not <c>Volatile</c>: they are written once by a benchmark before it starts an arm and read on
/// the query path, never flipped while a query is in flight.</para>
