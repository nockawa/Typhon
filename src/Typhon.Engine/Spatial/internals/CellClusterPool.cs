/// <summary>
/// Flat-array pool holding per-cell cluster lists for a single archetype. Each cell gets a contiguous segment inside <see cref="_pool"/>; iteration is a
/// single sequential read, matching the layout the design doc describes as "Option B: Compact array per cell" in
/// <c>claude/design/Spatial/SpatialTiers/01-spatial-clusters.md</c>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>Issue #229 Q10 resolution (issue #230 follow-up): this pool was originally owned by <c>SpatialGrid</c> and shared across archetypes, which
/// conflated cluster chunk IDs that are only meaningful inside a single archetype's <see cref="ArchetypeClusterState.ClusterSegment"/>. Under Q10 the pool
/// is instead owned by each <see cref="ArchetypeClusterState"/> (one instance per cluster-spatial archetype) so two archetypes sharing the same grid cell
/// no longer collide on chunk IDs. The pool is now fully self-contained — it owns its own per-cell head / count / capacity arrays and does not touch
/// <see cref="CellState"/> at all. Global per-cell totals (<see cref="CellState.ClusterCount"/> and <see cref="CellState.EntityCount"/>)
/// are maintained separately by the archetype state call sites.</para>
/// <para>Growth strategy: each cell starts with zero capacity. On the first insert we allocate a small tail segment (capacity 4) at the current
/// <see cref="_tail"/> offset and record its head. When that segment fills up we allocate a new tail segment at 2× capacity, copy the old entries across,
/// and update the per-cell head. The abandoned segment becomes dead space inside the pool — acceptable because cell cluster counts change slowly, cell
/// grids are small (a few hundred KB per archetype), and compacting would complicate lookups without any measurable benefit at our scales.</para>
/// <para><b>The `_pool` array itself is still resized in place</b> (<see cref="EnsurePoolCapacity"/>), so a <see cref="ReadOnlySpan{T}"/> from
/// <see cref="GetClusters"/> must not be held across a concurrent <see cref="AddCluster"/> on ANOTHER cell — the span would point into the orphaned
/// array. That is unchanged from before the per-cell arrays were chunked, and it is why they were: those four are read by every claim path, whereas the
/// pool span is consumed immediately by its caller. Chunking `_pool` as well would remove the caveat and is the obvious next step if a caller ever needs
/// to hold one.</para>
/// <para>Removal uses swap-with-last — the per-cell count shrinks; the last entry in the segment moves into the vacated slot. This means clusters attached
/// to a cell have no stable index inside the pool; callers must not cache positions.</para>
/// <para><b>Single-writer contract.</b> <see cref="AddCluster"/> and <see cref="RemoveCluster"/> must never run concurrently with each other on one pool
/// instance. That is the caller's job and it already does it: both <c>ClaimSlotInCell</c> overloads call <see cref="AddCluster"/> under
/// <c>_finalizeLock</c>'s exclusive access, the startup rebuild calls it from its serial reduce, and both <see cref="RemoveCluster"/> callers are serial for
/// the archetype (<c>DrainPendingClusterFinalizations</c> runs after the fence phase barriers; the inline <c>ReleaseSlot</c> path has a single-threaded
/// caller). The pool holds no lock of its own, and one over the side arrays would be theatre: <see cref="AddCluster"/> goes on to write <c>_pool</c>, bump
/// <c>_tail</c> and <c>Array.Resize</c> the pool array, none of which such a lock would cover — two genuinely racing writers would corrupt the pool with it
/// held. Rather than a comment asserting the contract, <see cref="EnterWriter"/> DETECTS a breach; see its remarks.</para>
/// <para><b>Readers are a different matter and are genuinely concurrent.</b> <c>ClaimSlotInCell</c>'s hot path calls <see cref="GetClusters"/>,
/// <see cref="GetClusterCount"/> and the scan-cursor accessors from fence workers while another worker may be inside <see cref="AddCluster"/>. They are safe
/// because a chunk, once published, is never moved and every structural load is a volatile acquire — not because of any mutual exclusion. The scan cursors
/// stay outside the writer guard deliberately: they are per-cell single-writer hints (see <see cref="_cellScanCursor"/>) on the hot claim path, where an
/// interlocked round trip would cost more than the staleness it prevents.</para>
