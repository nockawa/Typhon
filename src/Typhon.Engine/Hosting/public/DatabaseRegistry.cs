         Typhon — machine-local database registry
         ========================================

         Every Typhon process records the databases it opens here, one small JSON file per
         database, named after a hash of the database's absolute path. Nothing but this
         directory is written: the databases themselves are untouched, and deleting a file
         here only makes the Workbench forget where that database was.

         Its only purpose is discoverability — so a tool can list databases this machine has
         seen without you browsing for them. Nothing depends on it being complete or correct.

         Databases created under the operating system's temporary directory are never
         recorded, so test suites and throwaway fixtures do not appear here.

         To turn it off
         --------------

         Any one of these stops registration:

           1. Create an empty file named "{DisabledMarkerFileName}" in this directory.
              Machine-wide, survives upgrades, takes effect immediately.

           2. Set the environment variable {DisableEnvironmentVariable}=off
              for the process or the machine.

           3. In code, before opening a database:
              Typhon.Engine.DatabaseRegistry.SuppressForProcess = true;

         Existing files are not deleted when you disable it — remove them yourself, or use
         the Workbench's Known-databases list.
