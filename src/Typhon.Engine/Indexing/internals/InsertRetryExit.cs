/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// #738 exists because all seventeen collapsed into one counter. <c>AddOrUpdateCorePessimistic</c>'s retry loop increments a single restart tally and bounds
/// on <c>MaxPessimisticRestarts</c>, so a nightly record of a restart storm said how MANY times the operation gave up and nothing about WHERE — and the fix
/// for each of these is different. Two of the seventeen were counted before this table existed, both into <c>ObsoleteRestarts</c>, which the stress harness
/// did not even sample.
/// <para>
/// The four <c>*LockFailed</c> codes matter most, because they are invisible in every other instrument. <see cref="OlcLatch.TryWriteLock"/> does not spin and
/// never touches <c>_writeLockFailures</c> — that counter tallies <c>SpinWriteLock</c> iterations only. So a convoy on a shared ancestor produces a record
/// reading <c>WriteLockFails +0</c>, which is easily misread as "no lock contention" when it means "nobody spun". The 2026-08-31 nightly is exactly that
/// record.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Ordered root → leaf, following the method. <see cref="Unknown"/> is the initial value and must never be counted: a non-zero tally there means a bail was
/// added without a reason code, which <c>BTreeRetryExitInstrumentationTests</c> asserts against.
