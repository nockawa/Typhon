    // 8000-byte raw-data area = 2000 entries), carrying no segment data — so the CK-05 twin protects only the immutable
    // directory, never live data. The occupancy genesis therefore reserves one extra page (the occupancy bitmap's first
    // data page) and segments always span >= 2 pages. v3 (segment-directory twins, occupancy reserve = Int3) and earlier
    // are refused — no backward compat.
    //
    // v5 (#629): every archetype is cluster-backed, so the on-disk shape changed in three ways that a v4 file cannot
    // satisfy. Archetypes that were FLAT now carry a cluster segment; their EntityMap records changed shape (flat
    // header 14 + Location[slot]*4 vs cluster 19 = header 14 + ClusterChunkId 4 + SlotIndex 1, then chain roots indexed
    // by VERSIONED ordinal); and secondary-index leaf VALUES changed meaning, from a CompRev chain root to a packed
    // ClusterLocation (clusterChunkId*64 + slotIndex). The four per-ComponentTable index segments are gone and the
    // three system tables shrank from FromInt4 to FromInt2.
    //
    // The bump is what makes the break HONEST. None of the above is self-describing: a v4 EntityMap record read as a
    // cluster record finds ClusterChunkId where Location[0] lived, and a v4 index leaf read as a ClusterLocation
    // resolves to a plausible-looking but wrong cluster slot. Both silently serve corrupt data rather than failing.
    // Pre-alpha means no migration is owed — it does NOT mean a stale file may open and answer wrongly.
    // 6: per-sector page verification (PageSectorFooter). A page that declares sector geometry stores a CRC32C + currency
    //    stamp per 512 B sector in the free tail of its metadata region, and its PageChecksum field becomes a CRC over that
    //    footer rather than over the whole page. A revision-5 reader would compute a whole-page checksum and report every
    //    such page as corrupt, so the bump is what turns a confusing false alarm into a clean "incompatible format" refusal.
    //
    // 8 (#872 step 13): the entity-level spatial index is gone, and a v7 file carries structures this build will never
    //    account for. Every component with a [SpatialIndex] field used to allocate up to three persisted
    //    StorageSegmentKind.Spatial segments — an R-Tree, a back-pointer segment, and a Layer-1 occupancy hashmap — plus a
    //    `spatial.<component>` bootstrap entry naming their root pages. Nothing allocates, reads or frees any of them now.
    //    Opened by this build, a v7 file's Spatial pages are allocated and owned by nothing: the page classifier cannot
    //    name them, the integrity checker cannot reach them, and they are never reclaimed. That is what the bump refuses.
    //
    //    🔴 CORRECTED. The first version of this note claimed the LEAF LAYOUT was the dangerous half — the R-Tree leaf
    //    entry did lose its 4-byte ComponentChunkId column (R2Df32 15 -> 17, R3Df32 11 -> 13), and the note asserted that
    //    the per-cell CLUSTER trees share that layout and "ARE written", so a v7 leaf read with v8 offsets would serve
    //    wrong clusters. They are NOT written: CellClusterTree is SpatialRTree<TransientStore> over a segment built by
    //    CreateTransientClusterSegment — heap-backed, no file I/O. After this step NO persisted structure uses the leaf
    //    layout at all, so that scenario is unreachable. The bump is still correct; the reason above is the real one. A
    //    wrong reason on a format gate is worse than none, because the next person to weigh a layout change weighs it
    //    against a hazard that does not exist.
