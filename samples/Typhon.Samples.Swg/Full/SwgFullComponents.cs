// World Shard — Full tier. The rich counterpart to Light's single Character: a living shard of Players (with guilds,
// wallets, inventories), the Structures they own (Harvesters + Factories), the Resource taxonomy and Deposits they
// gather from, and the Recipes + Items they craft. Where Light is the minimal slice a newcomer copies, Full is the
// reference schema that gives the Workbench (Schema / Data / Query / File-Map views) and the MonitoringDemo real,
// relationship-rich data to render and drive load against.
//
// SAME DISCIPLINE AS LIGHT: each component sits in the storage mode its ACCESS PATTERN calls for — never a blanket
// default. That judgment is the point; the mode is not incidental.
//   • SingleVersion — hot / high-frequency / loss-tolerant: every spatial Position, a harvester's filling Hopper, a
//     factory's draining PowerSupply, a harvester's MaintenanceState. Lock-free, no MVCC tax — exactly Light's Transform.
//   • Versioned — durable, transactional, ACID: identity + progression (Player), the economy (Wallet, Guild.Treasury),
//     ownership + inventory (Item, StructureOwner, ItemOwner), the durable catalog (ResourceType, Recipe, Deposit).
//     These are records you must not lose or read torn — what MVCC + WAL are for, touched at event cadence not per tick.
//   • Transient — pure scratch: Session (online/offline connection state), dropped on restart by design — Light's Intent.
//
// The relational surface (EntityLink<T> FKs incl. cascade-delete and a self-referential FK, ComponentCollection,
// [ComponentFamily] grouping, polymorphic Structure) is here because a real shard HAS relationships and a fixture must
// exercise them for the Workbench to render them — NOT because you should reach for a foreign key by default. Each FK
// models a genuine ownership / membership / taxonomy edge; being fixture data, none is chased in a hot per-tick loop.
//
// NOTE on multi-value FKs: ComponentCollection<T> elements are opaque VSBS payloads and cannot be indexed FKs, so
// RecipeSlot.ClassReq is a plain resource-type id (int), not an EntityLink. NOTE on spatial: a single shared Position
// struct cannot present different Category/Mode per archetype (the attribute is per-struct, compile-time), so there are
// three distinct *Position structs; StructurePosition is still shared by Harvester + Factory.
//
// Every field carries [Field] — required by the Typhon.Shell AssemblySchemaLoader (skips unmarked fields) and harmless
// to the engine registration path (which reads all public fields regardless).
//
// Paired with SwgFullArchetypes.cs, which groups these components into the 9 archetypes. Component identities are
// prefixed "Swg."; archetype ids are engine-assigned (feature #514 — no author-set id).
