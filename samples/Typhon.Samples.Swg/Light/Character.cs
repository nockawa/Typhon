// SWG Light — the minimal slice: one planet shard of the galaxy, alive with characters.
//
// A single archetype, Character, is any faction-aligned being in the world — an NPC here, since the tick loop drives
// them by AI, but the same shape a player character has. It roams the planet, regenerates its HAM pools, senses its
// surroundings, and trades credits with other characters in atomic, snapshot-isolated transactions. (The Full tier's
// Player is this plus an account, a guild membership and a session — a Character with an identity attached.)
//
// The point of this sample is JUDGMENT, not a feature checklist: each component sits in the storage mode its access
// pattern actually calls for. That single choice is the whole difference between a fast Typhon schema and a slow one:
//
//   • SingleVersion (Transform, Bounds, Ham, Faction) — hot, per-tick, loss-tolerant state. Written lock-free by
//     parallel systems through the per-worker accessor, laid out SoA for cache-friendly scans. ~40 ns/write.
//   • Versioned     (Wallet) — the ECONOMY: full MVCC + WAL. Snapshot-isolated, durable, transactional (rolls back
//     cleanly). Touched ONLY when an economic event fires (a trade or a reward), NEVER every tick. ~250 ns/write.
//   • Transient     (Intent) — per-tick AI scratch (the wander target); heap-only, dropped on restart by design.
//
// Note what is DELIBERATELY absent: no Versioned component in the tick loop (that is a ~6× write tax for data that
// needs neither isolation nor history), and no ComponentCollection / EntityLink indirection in a minimal seed. The
// index on Faction lives on a SingleVersion component — a secondary index does NOT require Versioned storage.
//
// This slice is standalone (it references no other sample type), so it compiles on its own. It is exactly the source
// `typhon new` emits and what the getting-started guide runs. The Full tier (Full/*.cs) adds the relational surface
// the harvesting/crafting economy needs — deposits, harvesters, factories, schematics, items — while the seed stays lean.
